Introduction to Classical Mechanics

This textbook covers all the standard introductory topics in classical mechanics,
including Newton’s laws, oscillations, energy, momentum, angular momentum,
planetary motion, and special relativity. It also explores more advanced topics,
such as normal modes, the Lagrangian method, gyroscopic motion, fictitious
forces, 4-vectors, and general relativity.

It contains more than 250 problems with detailed solutions so students can
easily check their understanding of the topic. There are also over 350 unworked
exercises, which are ideal for homework assignments. Password-protected
solutions are available to instructors at www.cambridge.org/9780521876223.
The vast number of problems alone makes it an ideal supplementary book for
all levels of undergraduate physics courses in classical mechanics. The text also
includes many additional remarks which discuss issues that are often glossed
over in other textbooks, and it is thoroughly illustrated with more than 600
figures to help demonstrate key concepts.

David Morin is a Lecturer in the Physics Department at Harvard University. He
received his Ph.D. in theoretical particle physics from Harvard in 1996. When not
writing physics limericks or thinking of new problems whose answers involve e
or the golden ratio, he can be found running along the Charles River or hiking in
the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

Preface

This book grew out of Harvard University’s honors freshman mechanics course.
It is essentially two books in one. Roughly half of each chapter follows the form of
a normal textbook, consisting of text, along with exercises suitable for homework
assignments. The other half takes the form of a “problem book,” with all sorts
of problems (and solutions) of varying degrees of difficulty. I’ve always thought
that doing problems is the best way to learn, so if you’ve been searching for a
supply to puzzle over, I think this will keep you busy for a while.

This book is somewhat of a quirky one, so let me say right at the start how I

imagine it being used:

• As the primary text for honors freshman mechanics courses. My original motivation
for writing it was the fact that there didn’t exist a suitable book for Harvard’s freshman
course. So after nine years of using updated versions in the class, here is the finished
product.

• As a supplementary text for standard freshman courses for physics majors. Although
this book starts at the beginning of mechanics and is self contained, it doesn’t spend
as much time on the introductory material as other freshman books do. I therefore
don’t recommend using this as the only text for a standard freshman mechanics course.
However, it will make an extremely useful supplement, both as a problem book for all
students, and as a more advanced textbook for students who want to dive further into
certain topics.

• As a supplementary text for upper-level mechanics courses, or as the primary text which
is supplemented with another book for additional topics often covered in upper-level
courses, such as Hamilton’s equations, fluids, chaos, Fourier analysis, electricity and
magnetism applications, etc. With all of the worked examples and in-depth discussions,
you really can’t go wrong in pairing up this book with another one.

• As a problem book for anyone who likes solving physics problems. This audience
ranges from advanced high-school students, who I think will have a ball with it, to
undergraduate and graduate students who want some amusing problems to ponder, to
professors who are looking for a new supply of problems to use in their classes, and
finally to anyone with a desire to learn about physics by doing problems. If you want,
you can consider this to be a problem book that also happens to have comprehensive

xiii

Preface

introductions to each topic’s set of problems. With about 250 problems (with included
solutions) and 350 exercises (without included solutions), in addition to all the examples
in the text, I think you’ll get your money’s worth! But just in case, I threw in 600 figures,
50 limericks, nine appearances of the golden ratio, and one cameo of e

−π

.

The prerequisites for the book are solid high-school foundations in mechanics
(no electricity and magnetism required) and single-variable calculus. There are
two minor exceptions to this. First, a few sections rely on multivariable calcu-
lus, so I have given a review of this in Appendix B. The bulk of it comes in
Section 5.3 (which involves the curl), but this section can easily be skipped on
a first reading. Other than that, there are just some partial derivatives, dot prod-
ucts, and cross products (all of which are reviewed in Appendix B) sprinkled
throughout the book. Second, a few sections (4.5, 9.2–9.3, and Appendices D
and E) rely on matrices and other elementary topics from linear algebra. But a
basic understanding of matrices should suffice here.

A brief outline of the book is as follows. Chapter 1 discusses various problem-
solving strategies. This material is extremely important, so if you read only one
chapter in the book, make it this one. You should keep these strategies on the
tip of your brain as you march through the rest of the book. Chapter 2 covers
statics. Most of this will likely be familiar, but you’ll find some fun problems.
In Chapter 3, we learn about forces and how to apply F = ma. There’s a bit of
math here needed for solving some simple differential equations. Chapter 4 deals
with oscillations and coupled oscillators. Again, there’s a fair bit of math needed
for solving linear differential equations, but there’s no way to avoid it. Chapter 5
deals with conservation of energy and momentum. You’ve probably seen much
of this before, but it has lots of neat problems.

In Chapter 6, we introduce the Lagrangian method, which will most likely be
new to you. It looks rather formidable at first, but it’s really not all that rough.
There are difficult concepts at the heart of the subject, but the nice thing is that the
technique is easy to apply. The situation here is analogous to taking a derivative
in calculus; there are substantive concepts on which the theory rests, but the act
of taking a derivative is fairly straightforward.

Chapter 7 deals with central forces and planetary motion. Chapter 8 covers
the easier type of angular momentum situations, where the direction of the
angular momentum vector is fixed. Chapter 9 covers the more difficult type,
where the direction changes. Spinning tops and other perplexing objects fall into
this category. Chapter 10 deals with accelerating reference frames and fictitious
forces.

Chapters 11 through 14 cover relativity. Chapter 11 deals with relativistic
kinematics – abstract particles flying through space and time. Chapter 12 covers
relativistic dynamics – energy, momentum, force, etc. Chapter 13 introduces the
important concept of “4-vectors.” The material in this chapter could alternatively
be put in the previous two, but for various reasons I thought it best to create a

Preface

xv

separate chapter for it. Chapter 14 covers a few topics from General Relativity.
It’s impossible for one chapter to do this subject justice, of course, so we’ll just
look at some basic (but still very interesting) examples. Finally, the appendices
cover various useful, but slightly tangential, topics.

Throughout the book, I have included many “Remarks.” These are written
in a slightly smaller font than the surrounding text. They begin with a small-
capital “Remark” and end with a shamrock (♣). The purpose of these remarks is
to say something that needs to be said, without disrupting the overall flow of the
argument. In some sense these are “extra” thoughts, although they are invariably
useful in understanding what is going on. They are usually more informal than
the rest of the text, and I reserve the right to use them to occasionally babble
about things that I find interesting, but that you may find tangential. For the most
part, however, the remarks address issues that arise naturally in the course of the
discussion. I often make use of “Remarks” at the ends of the solutions to problems,
where the obvious thing to do is to check limiting cases (this topic is discussed in
Chapter 1). However, in this case, the remarks are not “extra” thoughts, because
checking limiting cases of your answer is something you should always do.

For your reading pleasure (I hope!), I have included limericks throughout the
text. I suppose that these might be viewed as educational, but they certainly don’t
represent any deep insight I have into the teaching of physics. I have written them
for the sole purpose of lightening things up. Some are funny. Some are stupid.
But at least they’re all physically accurate (give or take).

As mentioned above, this book contains a huge number of problems. The ones
with included solutions are called “Problems,” and the ones without included
solutions, which are intended to be used for homework assignments, are called
“Exercises.” There is no fundamental difference between these two types, except
for the existence of written-up solutions. I have chosen to include the solutions
to the problems for two reasons. First, students invariably want extra practice
problems, with solutions, to work on. And second, I had a thoroughly enjoyable
time writing them up. But a warning on these problems and exercises: Some are
easy, but many are very difficult. I think you’ll find them quite interesting, but
don’t get discouraged if you have trouble solving them. Some are designed to be
brooded over for hours. Or days, or weeks, or months (as I can attest to!).

The problems (and exercises) are marked with a number of stars (actually
asterisks). Harder problems earn more stars, on a scale from zero to four. Of
course, you may disagree with my judgment of difficulty, but I think that an
arbitrary weighting scheme is better than none at all. As a rough idea of what I
mean by the number of stars, one-star problems are solid problems that require
some thought, and four-star problems are really, really, really hard. Try a few
and you’ll see what I mean. Even if you understand the material in the text
backwards and forwards, the four-star (and many of the three-star) problems will
still be extremely challenging. But that’s how it should be. My goal was to create
an unreachable upper bound on the number (and difficulty) of problems, because

xvi

Preface

it would be an unfortunate circumstance if you were left twiddling your thumbs,
having run out of problems to solve. I hope I have succeeded.

For the problems you choose to work on, be careful not to look at the solution
too soon. There’s nothing wrong with putting a problem aside for a while and
coming back to it later. Indeed, this is probably the best way to learn things. If
you head to the solution at the first sign of not being able to solve a problem,
then you have wasted the problem.

Remark: This gives me an opportunity for my first remark (and first limerick, too). A fact that
often gets overlooked is that you need to know more than the correct way(s) to do a problem; you
also need to be familiar with many incorrect ways of doing it. Otherwise, when you come upon
a new problem, there may be a number of decent-looking approaches to take, and you won’t be
able to immediately weed out the poor ones. Struggling a bit with a problem invariably leads
you down some wrong paths, and this is an essential part of learning. To understand something,
you not only have to know what’s right about the right things; you also have to know what’s
wrong about the wrong things. Learning takes a serious amount of effort, many wrong turns,
and a lot of sweat. Alas, there are no shortcuts to understanding physics.

Any book that takes ten years to write is bound to contain the (greatly appreci-
ated) input of many people. I am particularly thankful for Howard Georgi’s help
over the years, with his numerous suggestions, ideas for many problems, and
physics sanity checks. I would also like to thank Don Page for his entertaining
and meticulous comments and suggestions, and an eye for catching errors in ear-
lier versions. Other friends and colleagues who have helped make this book what
it is (and who have made it all the more fun to write) are John Bechhoefer, Wes
Campbell, Michelle Cyrier, Alex Dahlen, Gary Feldman, Lukasz Fidkowski,

and Eric Zaslow. I’m sure that I have forgotten others, especially from the earlier
years where my memory fades, so please accept my apologies.

I am also grateful for the highly professional work done by the editorial and
production group at Cambridge University Press in transforming this into an
actual book. It has been a pleasure working with Lindsay Barnes, Simon Capelin,
Margaret Patterson, and Dawn Preston.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to thank all the students
(both at Harvard and elsewhere) who provided input during the past decade.

The names here are literally too numerous to write down, so let me simply say a
big thank you, and that I hope other students will enjoy what you helped create.
Despite the painstaking proofreading and all the eyes that have passed over
earlier versions, there is at most an exponentially small probability that the
book is error free. So if something looks amiss, please check the webpage
(www.cambridge.org/9780521876223) for a list of typos, updates, etc. And
please let me know if you discover something that isn’t already posted. I’m
sure that eventually I will post some new problems and supplementary material,
so be sure to check the webpage for additions. Information for instructors will
also be available on this site.

Happy problem solving – I hope you enjoy the book!

Chapter 1
Strategies for solving problems

Physics involves a great deal of problem solving. Whether you are doing
cutting-edge research or reading a book on a well-known subject, you are going
to need to solve some problems. In the latter case (the presently relevant one,
given what is in your hand right now), it is fairly safe to say that the true test
of understanding something is the ability to solve problems on it. Reading about
a topic is often a necessary step in the learning process, but it is by no means
a sufficient one. The more important step is spending as much time as possible
solving problems (which is inevitably an active task) beyond the time you spend
reading (which is generally a more passive task). I have therefore included a very
large number of problems/exercises in this book.

However, if I’m going to throw all these problems at you, I should at least give
you some general strategies for solving them. These strategies are the subject of
the present chapter. They are things you should always keep in the back of your
mind when tackling a problem. Of course, they are generally not sufficient by
themselves; you won’t get too far without understanding the physical concepts
behind the subject at hand. But when you add these strategies to your physical
understanding, they can make your life a lot easier.

1.1 General strategies

There are a number of general strategies you should invoke without hesitation
when solving a problem. They are:

1. Draw a diagram, if appropriate.

In the diagram, be sure to label clearly all the relevant quantities (forces, lengths,
masses, etc.). Diagrams are absolutely critical in certain types of problems. For
example, in problems involving “free-body” diagrams (discussed in Chapter 3) or
relativistic kinematics (discussed in Chapter 11), drawing a diagram can change a
hopelessly complicated problem into a near-trivial one. And even in cases where
diagrams aren’t this crucial, they’re invariably very helpful. A picture is definitely
worth a thousand words (and even a few more, if you label things!).

Strategies for solving problems

2. Write down what you know, and what you are trying to find.

In a simple problem, you may just do this in your head without realizing it. But in
more difficult problems, it is very useful to explicitly write things out. For example,
if there are three unknowns that you’re trying to find, but you’ve written down
only two facts, then you know there must be another fact you’re missing (assuming
that the problem is in fact solvable), so you can go searching for it. It might be a
conservation law, or an F = ma equation, etc.

3. Solve things symbolically.

If you are solving a problem where the given quantities are specified numerically,
you should immediately change the numbers to letters and solve the problem in terms
of the letters. After you obtain an answer in terms of the letters, you can plug in the
actual numerical values to obtain a numerical answer. There are many advantages
to using letters:
• It’s quicker. It’s much easier to multiply a g by an (cid:2) by writing them down on a
piece of paper next to each other, than it is to multiply them together on a calculator.
And with the latter strategy, you’d undoubtedly have to pick up your calculator at
least a few times during the course of a problem.

• You’re less likely to make a mistake. It’s very easy to mistype an 8 for a 9 in
a calculator, but you’re probably not going to miswrite a q for a g on a piece of
paper. But if you do, you’ll quickly realize that it should be a g. You certainly
won’t just give up on the problem and deem it unsolvable because no one gave
you the value of q!

• You can do the problem once and for all. If someone comes along and says,
oops, the value of (cid:2) is actually 2.4 m instead of 2.3 m, then you won’t have to do
the whole problem again. You can simply plug the new value of (cid:2) into your final
symbolic answer.

• You can see the general dependence of your answer on the various given quan-
tities. For example, you can see that it grows with quantities a and b, decreases with
c, and doesn’t depend on d. There is much, much more information contained in a
symbolic answer than in a numerical one. And besides, symbolic answers nearly
always look nice and pretty.

• You can check units and special cases. These checks go hand-in-hand with the
previous “general dependence” advantage. But since they’re so important, we’ll
postpone their discussion and devote Sections 1.2 and 1.3 to them.

Having said all this, it should be noted that there are occasionally times when things
get a bit messy when working with letters. For example, solving a system of three
equations in three unknowns might be rather cumbersome unless you plug in the
actual numbers. But in the vast majority of problems, it is highly advantageous to
work entirely with letters.

4. Consider units/dimensions.

This is extremely important. See Section 1.2 for a detailed discussion.

1.1 General strategies

3

5. Check limiting/special cases.

This is also extremely important. See Section 1.3 for a detailed discussion.

6. Check order of magnitude if you end up getting a numerical answer.

If you end up with an actual numerical answer to a problem, be sure to do a san-
ity check to see if the number is reasonable. If you’ve calculated the distance
along the ground that a car skids before it comes to rest, and if you’ve gotten
an answer of a kilometer or a millimeter, then you know you’ve probably done
something wrong. Errors of this sort often come from forgetting some powers of
10 (say, when converting kilometers to meters) or from multiplying something
instead of dividing (although you should be able to catch this by checking your
units, too).

You will inevitably encounter problems, physics ones or otherwise, where
you don’t end up obtaining a rigorous answer, either because the calculation is
intractable, or because you just don’t feel like doing it. But in these cases it’s
usually still possible to make an educated guess, to the nearest power of 10. For
example, if you walk past a building and happen to wonder how many bricks
are in it, or what the labor cost was in constructing it, then you can probably
give a reasonable answer without doing any severe computations. The physicist
Enrico Fermi was known for his ability to estimate things quickly and produce
order-of-magnitude guesses with only minimal calculation. Hence, a problem
where the goal is to simply obtain the nearest power-of-10 estimate is known as a
“Fermi problem.” Of course, sometimes in life you need to know things to better
accuracy than the nearest power of 10 . . .

How Fermi could estimate things!
Like the well-known Olympic ten rings,
And the one hundred states,
And weeks with ten dates,
And birds that all fly with one . . . wings.

In the following two sections, we’ll discuss the very important strategies of
checking units and special cases. Then in Section 1.4 we’ll discuss the technique
of solving problems numerically, which is what you need to do when you end up
with a set of equations you can’t figure out how to solve. Section 1.4 isn’t quite
analogous to Sections 1.2 and 1.3, in that these first two are relevant to basically
any problem you’ll ever do, whereas solving equations numerically is something
you’ll do only for occasional problems. But it’s nevertheless something that every
physics student should know.

In all three of these sections, we’ll invoke various results derived later in the
book. For the present purposes, the derivations of these results are completely
irrelevant, so don’t worry at all about the physics behind them – there will be

4

Strategies for solving problems

plenty of opportunity for that later on! The main point here is to learn what to do
with the result of a problem once you’ve obtained it.

1.2 Units, dimensional analysis

The units, or dimensions, of a quantity are the powers of mass, length, and time
associated with it. For example, the units of a speed are length per time. The
consideration of units offers two main benefits. First, looking at units before
you start a problem can tell you roughly what the answer has to look like, up
to numerical factors. Second, checking units at the end of a calculation (which
is something you should always do) can tell you if your answer has a chance at
being correct. It won’t tell you that your answer is definitely correct, but it might
tell you that your answer is definitely incorrect. For example, if your goal in a
problem is to find a length, and if you end up with a mass, then you know it’s
time to look back over your work.

“Your units are wrong!” cried the teacher.
“Your church weighs six joules – what a feature!
And the people inside
Are four hours wide,
And eight gauss away from the preacher!”

In practice, the second of the above two benefits is what you will generally
make use of. But let’s do a few examples relating to the first benefit, because
these can be a little more exciting. To solve the three examples below exactly, we
would need to invoke results derived in later chapters. But let’s just see how far we
can get by using only dimensional analysis. We’ll use the “[ ]” notation for units,
and we’ll let M stand for mass, L for length, and T for time. For example, we’ll
write a speed as [v] = L/T and the gravitational constant as [G] = L3/(MT 2)
(you can figure this out by noting that Gm1m2/r2 has the dimensions of force,
which in turn has dimensions ML/T 2, from F = ma). Alternatively, you can just
use the mks units, kg, m, s, instead of M , L, T , respectively.1

Example (Pendulum): A mass m hangs from a massless string of length (cid:2)
(see Fig. 1.1) and swings back and forth in the plane of the paper. The acceleration
due to gravity is g. What can we say about the frequency of oscillations?

Solution: The only dimensionful quantities given in the problem are [m] = M ,
[(cid:2)] = L, and [g] = L/T 2. But there is one more quantity, the maximum angle θ0,
which is dimensionless (and easy to forget). Our goal is to find the frequency, which

1 When you check units at the end of a calculation, you will invariably be working with the kg,m,s
notation. So that notation will inevitably get used more. But I’ll use the M , L, T notation here,
because I think it’s a little more instructive. At any rate, just remember that the letter m (or M )
stands for “meter” in one case, and “mass” in the other.

has units of 1/T . The only combination of our given dimensionful quantities that has
units of 1/T is
g/(cid:2). But we can’t rule out any θ0 dependence, so the most general
possible form of the frequency is2

where f is a dimensionless function of the dimensionless variable θ0.
Remarks:

√

1. It just so happens that for small oscillations, f (θ0) is essentially equal to 1, so the
g/(cid:2). But there is no way to show this by using
frequency is essentially equal to
only dimensional analysis; you actually have to solve the problem for real. For
larger values of θ0, the higher-order terms in the expansion of f become important.
Exercise 4.23 deals with the leading correction, and the answer turns out to be f (θ0) =
1 − θ 2
0

/16 + · · · .

2. Since there is only one mass in the problem, there is no way that the frequency (with
units of 1/T ) can depend on [m] = M . If it did, there would be nothing to cancel the
units of mass and produce a pure inverse-time.

√

3. We claimed above that the only combination of our given dimensionful quantities
g/(cid:2). This is easy to see here, but in more complicated
that has units of 1/T is
problems where the correct combination isn’t so obvious, the following method will
always work. Write down a general product of the given dimensionful quantities
raised to arbitrary powers (ma(cid:2)bgc in this problem), and then write out the units of
this product in terms of a, b, and c. If we want to obtain units of 1/T here, then
we need

(1.2)

Matching up the powers of the three kinds of units on each side of this equation gives

M : a = 0,

L : b + c = 0,

T : −2c = −1.

(1.3)

The solution to this system of equations is a = 0, b = −1/2, and c = 1/2, so we
have reproduced the

g/(cid:2) result. ♣

√

What can we say about the total energy of the pendulum (with the potential energy
measured relative to the lowest point)? We’ll talk about energy in Chapter 5, but
the only thing we need to know here is that energy has units of ML2/T 2. The only
combination of the given dimensionful constants of this form is mg(cid:2). But again, we
can’t rule out any θ0 dependence, so the energy must take the form f (θ0)mg(cid:2), where
f is some function. That’s as far as we can go with dimensional analysis. However,
if we actually invoke a little physics, we can say that the total energy equals the
potential energy at the highest point, which is mg(cid:2)(1 − cos θ0). Using the Taylor
expansion for cos θ (see Appendix A for a discussion of Taylor series), we see that
f (θ0) = θ 2
/24 + · · · . So in contrast with the frequency result above, the
0
maximum angle θ0 plays a critical role in the energy.

2 We’ll measure frequency here in radians per second, denoted by ω. So we’re actually talking about
the “angular frequency.” Just divide by 2π (which doesn’t affect the units) to obtain the “regular”
frequency in cycles per second (hertz), usually denoted by ν. We’ll talk at great length about
oscillations in Chapter 4.

Example (Spring): A spring with spring constant k has a mass m on its end
(see Fig. 1.2). The spring force is F(x) = −kx, where x is the displacement from the
equilibrium position. What can we say about the frequency of oscillations?
Solution: The only dimensionful quantities in this problem are [m] = M , [k] =
M /T 2 (obtained by noting that kx has the dimensions of force), and the maximum
displacement from the equilibrium, [x0] = L. (There is also the equilibrium length,
but the force doesn’t depend on this, so there is no way it can come into the answer.)
Our goal is to find the frequency, which has units of 1/T . The only combination of
our given dimensionful quantities with these units is

(cid:1)

ω = C

,

(1.4)

where C is a dimensionless number. It just so happens that C is equal to 1 (assuming
that we’re measuring ω in radians per second), but there is no way to show this by
using only dimensional analysis. Note that, in contrast with the pendulum above, the
frequency cannot have any dependence on the maximum displacement.

/2.

What can we say about the total energy of the spring? Energy has units of ML2/T 2,
and the only combination of the given dimensionful constants of this form is Bkx2
0,
where B is a dimensionless number. It turns out that B = 1/2, so the total energy
equals kx2
0
Remark: A real spring doesn’t have a perfectly parabolic potential (that is, a perfectly
linear force), so the force actually looks something like F(x) = −kx + bx2 + · · · . If we
truncate the series at the second term, then we have one more dimensionful quantity to
work with, [b] = M /LT 2. To form a quantity with the dimensions of frequency, 1/T , we
need x0 and b to appear in the combination x0b, because this is the only way to get rid
of the L. You can then see (by using the strategy of writing out a general product of the
variables, discussed in the third remark in the pendulum example above) that the frequency
k/m, where f is some function. We can therefore have x0
must be of the form f (x0b/k)
k/m for b = 0. Hence, f must be
dependence in this case. This answer must reduce to C
of the form f (y) = C + c1y + c2y2 + · · · . ♣

Example (Low-orbit satellite): A satellite of mass m travels in a circular orbit
just above the earth’s surface. What can we say about its speed?
Solution: The only dimensionful quantities in the problem are [m] = M , [g] =
L/T 2, and the radius of the earth [R] = L. 3 Our goal is to find the speed, which has
units of L/T . The only combination of our dimensionful quantities with these units is

It turns out that C = 1.

3 You might argue that the mass of the earth, ME, and Newton’s gravitational constant, G, should
be also included here, because Newton’s gravitational force law for a particle on the surface of the
earth is F = GMEm/R2. But since this force can be written as m(GME/R2) ≡ mg, we can absorb
the effects of ME and G into g.

1.3 Approximations, limiting cases

1.3 Approximations, limiting cases

As with units, the consideration of limiting cases (or perhaps we should say
special cases) offers two main benefits. First, it can help you get started on a
problem. If you’re having trouble figuring out how a given system behaves,
then you can imagine making, for example, a certain length become very large or
very small, and then you can see what happens to the behavior. Having convinced
yourself that the length actually affects the system in extreme cases (or perhaps
you will discover that the length doesn’t affect things at all), it will then be
easier to understand how it affects the system in general, which will then make
it easier to write down the relevant quantitative equations (conservation laws,
F = ma equations, etc.), which will allow you to fully solve the problem. In
short, modifying the various parameters and observing the effects on the system
can lead to an enormous amount of information.

Second, as with checking units, checking limiting cases (or special cases)
is something you should always do at the end of a calculation. But as with
checking units, it won’t tell you that your answer is definitely correct, but
it might tell you that your answer is definitely incorrect. It is generally true
that your intuition about limiting cases is much better than your intuition
about generic values of the parameters. You should use this fact to your
advantage.

Let’s do a few examples relating to the second benefit. The initial expressions
given in each example below are taken from various examples throughout the
book, so just accept them for now. For the most part, I’ll repeat here what I’ll
say later on when we work through the problems for real. A tool that comes up
often in checking limiting cases is the Taylor series approximations; the series
for many functions are given in Appendix A.

Example (Dropped ball): A beach ball is dropped from rest at height h. Assume
that the drag force from the air takes the form Fd = −mαv. We’ll find in Section 3.3
that the ball’s velocity and position are given by

v(t) = − g

(1.6)

These expressions are a bit complicated, so for all you know, I could have made a
typo in writing them down. Or worse, I could have completely botched the solu-
tion. So let’s look at some limiting cases. If these limiting cases yield expected
then we can feel a little more confident that the answers are actually
results,
correct.

If t is very small (more precisely, if αt (cid:4) 1; see the discussion following this exam-
−x ≈ 1 − x + x2/2, to make approximations

ple), then we can use the Taylor series, e

plus terms of higher order in αt. This answer is expected, because the drag force is
negligible at the start, so we essentially have a freely falling body with acceleration
g downward. For small t, Eq. (1.6) also gives

y(t) = h − g

,

(1.8)

plus terms of higher order in αt. Again, this answer is expected, because we essentially
have a freely falling body at the start, so the distance fallen is the standard gt2/2.

We can also look at large t (or rather, large αt). In this case, e

−αt is essentially
zero, so the v(t) in Eq. (1.6) becomes (there’s no need for a Taylor series in this case)
v(t) ≈ − g
α .

(1.9)

This is the “terminal velocity.” Its value makes sense, because it is the velocity for
which the total force, −mg − mαv, vanishes. For large t, Eq. (1.6) also gives

y(t) ≈ h − gt
α

+ g
α2

.

(1.10)

Apparently for large t, g/α2 is the distance (and this does indeed have units of
−1, because mαv has units of force) that our ball lags
length, because α has units of T
behind another ball that started out already at the terminal velocity, −g/α.

Whenever you derive approximate answers as we just did, you gain something
and you lose something. You lose some truth, of course, because your new answer
is technically not correct. But you gain some aesthetics. Your new answer is
invariably much cleaner (sometimes involving only one term), and this makes it
a lot easier to see what’s going on.

In the above example, it actually makes no sense to look at the limit where
t is small or large, because t has dimensions. Is a year a large or small time?
How about a hundredth of a second? There is no way to answer this without
knowing what problem you’re dealing with. A year is short on the time scale
of galactic evolution, but a hundredth of a second is long on the time scale of
a nuclear process. It makes sense only to look at the limit of a small (or large)
dimensionless quantity. In the above example, this quantity is αt. The given
constant α has units of T −1, so 1/α sets a typical time scale for the system. It

1.3 Approximations, limiting cases

therefore makes sense to look at the limit where t (cid:4) 1/α (that is, αt (cid:4) 1), or
where t (cid:6) 1/α (that is, αt (cid:6) 1). In the limit of a small dimensionless quantity,
a Taylor series can be used to expand an answer in powers of the small quantity,
as we did above. We sometimes get sloppy and say things like, “In the limit
of small t.” But you know that we really mean, “In the limit of some small
dimensionless quantity that has a t in the numerator,” or, “In the limit where t is
much smaller that a certain quantity that has the dimensions of time.”

Remark: As mentioned above, checking special cases tells you that either (1) your answer is
consistent with your intuition, or (2) it’s wrong. It never tells you that it’s definitely correct.
This is the same as what happens with the scientific method. In the real world, everything comes
down to experiment. If you have a theory that you think is correct, then you need to check that
its predictions are consistent with experiments. The specific experiments you do are the analog
of the special cases you check after solving a problem; these two things represent what you
know is true. If the results of the experiments are inconsistent with your theory, then you need
to go back and fix your theory, just as you would need to go back and fix your answer. If, on
the other hand, the results are consistent, then although this is good, the only thing it really
tells you is that your theory might be correct. And considering the way things usually turn out,
the odds are that it’s not actually correct, but rather the limiting case of a more correct theory
(just as Newtonian physics is a limiting case of relativistic physics, which is a limiting case of
quantum field theory, etc.). That’s how physics works. You can’t prove anything, so you learn
to settle for the things you can’t disprove.

Consider, when seeking gestalts,
The theories that physics exalts.
It’s not that they’re known
To be written in stone.
It’s just that we can’t say they’re false. ♣

When making approximations, how do you know how many terms in the
Taylor series to keep? In the example above, we used e−x ≈ 1 − x + x2/2.
But why did we stop at the x2 term? The honest (but slightly facetious) answer
is, “Because I had already done this problem before writing it up, so I knew
how many terms to keep.” But the more informative (although perhaps no more
helpful) answer is that before you do the calculation, there’s really no way of
knowing how many terms to keep. So you should just keep a few and see what
happens. If everything ends up canceling out, then this tells you that you need to
repeat the calculation with another term in the series. For example, in Eq. (1.8),
if we had stopped the Taylor series at e−x ≈ 1 − x, then we would have obtained
y(t) = h − 0, which isn’t very useful, since the general goal is to get the leading-
order behavior in the parameter we’re looking at (which is t here). So in this
case we’d know we’d have to go back and include the x2/2 term in the series.
If we were doing a problem in which there was still no t (or whatever variable)
dependence at that order, then we’d have to go back and include the −x3/6 term
in the series. Of course, you could just play it safe and keep terms up to, say,
fifth order. But that’s invariably a poor strategy, because you’ll probably never
in your life have to go out that far in a series. So just start with one or two terms
and see what it gives you. Note that in Eq. (1.7), we actually didn’t need the

10

Strategies for solving problems

second-order term, so we in fact could have gotten by with only e−x ≈ 1 − x.
But having the extra term here didn’t end up causing much heartache.

After you make an approximation, how do you know if it’s a “good” one? Well,
just as it makes no sense to ask if a dimensionful quantity is large or small without
comparing it to another quantity, it makes no sense to ask if an approximation is
“good” or “bad” without stating the accuracy you want. In the above example, if
you’re looking at a t value for which αt ≈ 1/100, then the term we ignored in
Eq. (1.7) is smaller than gt by a factor αt/2 ≈ 1/200. So the error is on the order
of 1%. If this is enough accuracy for whatever purpose you have in mind, then
the approximation is a good one. If not, it’s a bad one, and you should add more
terms in the series until you get your desired accuracy.

The results of checking limits generally fall into two categories. Most of the
time you know what the result should be, so this provides a double-check on your
answer. But sometimes an interesting limit pops up that you might not expect.
Such is the case in the following examples.

m

v

M

Fig. 1.3

Example (Two masses in 1-D): A mass m with speed v approaches a stationary
mass M (see Fig. 1.3). The masses bounce off each other elastically. Assume that
all motion takes place in one dimension. We’ll find in Section 5.6.1 that the final
velocities of the particles are

vm =

(m − M )v
m + M

,

and

vM = 2mv
m + M

.

(1.11)

There are three special cases that beg to be checked:

• If m = M , then Eq. (1.11) tells us that m stops, and M picks up a speed v. This is
fairly believable (and even more so for pool players). And it becomes quite clear
once you realize that these final speeds certainly satisfy conservation of energy
and momentum with the initial conditions.

• If M (cid:6) m, then m bounces backward with speed ≈ v, and M hardly moves.

This makes sense, because M is basically a brick wall.

• If m (cid:6) M , then m keeps plowing along at speed ≈ v, and M picks up a speed
of ≈ 2v. This 2v is an unexpected and interesting result (it’s easier to see if you
consider what’s happening in the reference frame of the heavy mass m), and it
leads to some neat effects, as in Problem 5.23.

Example (Circular pendulum): A mass hangs from a massless string of length (cid:2).
Conditions have been set up so that the mass swings around in a horizontal circle,
with the string making a constant angle θ with the vertical (see Fig. 1.4). We’ll find
in Section 3.5 that the angular frequency, ω, of this motion is

(cid:1)

ω =

g
(cid:2) cos θ .

(1.12)

As far as θ is concerned, there are two limits we should definitely check:

• If θ → 90

, then ω → ∞. This makes sense; the mass has to spin very quickly

to avoid flopping down.
√

• If θ → 0, then ω →

g/(cid:2), which is the same as the frequency of a standard
“plane” pendulum of length (cid:2) (for small oscillations). This is a cool result and
not at all obvious. (But once we get to F = ma in Chapter 3, you can convince
yourself why this is true by looking at the projection of the force on a given
horizontal line.)

In the above examples, we checked limiting and special cases of answers
that were correct (I hope!). This whole process is more useful (and a bit more
fun, actually) when you check the limits of an answer that is incorrect. In this
case, you gain the unequivocal information that your answer is wrong. But
rather than leading you into despair, this information is in fact something you
should be quite happy about, considering that the alternative is to carry on in
a state of blissful ignorance. Once you know that your answer is wrong, you
can go back through your work and figure out where the error is (perhaps by
checking limits at various stages to narrow down where the error could be).
Personally, if there’s any way I’d like to discover that my answer is garbage,
this is it. At any rate, checking limiting cases can often save you a lot of trouble
in the long run…

The lemmings get set for their race.
With one step and two steps they pace.
They take three and four,
And then head on for more,
Without checking the limiting case.

1.4 Solving differential equations numerically

Solving a physics problem often involves solving a differential equation.
A differential equation is one that involves derivatives (usually with respect to
time, in our physics problems) of the variable you’re trying to solve for. The
differential equation invariably comes about from using F = ma, and/or τ = I α,
or the Lagrangian technique we’ll discuss in Chapter 6. For example, consider a
falling body. F = ma gives −mg = ma, which can be written as −g = ¨y, where
a dot denotes a time derivative. This is a rather simple differential equation, and
you can quickly guess that y(t) = −gt2/2 is a solution. Or, more generally with
the constants of integration thrown in, y(t) = y0 + v0t − gt2/2.

However, the differential equations produced in some problems can get rather
complicated, so sooner or later you will encounter one that you can’t solve exactly
(either because it’s in fact impossible to solve, or because you can’t think of the

12

Strategies for solving problems

appropriate clever trick). Having resigned yourself to not getting the exact answer,
you should ponder how to obtain a decent approximation to it. Fortunately, it’s
easy to write a short program that will give you a very good numerical answer to
your problem. Given enough computer time, you can obtain any desired accuracy
(assuming that the system isn’t chaotic, but we won’t have to worry about this
for the systems we’ll be dealing with).

We’ll demonstrate the procedure by considering a standard problem, one
that we’ll solve exactly and in great depth in Chapter 4. Consider the
equation,

¨x = −ω2x.

(1.13)

This is the equation for a mass on a spring, with ω =
Chapter 4 that the solution can be written, among other ways, as

k/m. We’ll find in

(cid:4)

x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ).

(1.14)

But let’s pretend we don’t know this. If someone comes along and gives us the
values of x(0) and ˙x(0), then it seems that somehow we should be able to find
x(t) and ˙x(t) for any later t, just by using Eq. (1.13). Basically, if we’re told how
the system starts, and if we know how it evolves, via Eq. (1.13), then we should
know everything about it. So here’s how we find x(t) and ˙x(t).

The plan is to discretize time into intervals of some small unit (call it (cid:9)), and
to then determine what happens at each successive point in time. If we know x(t)
and ˙x(t), then we can easily find (approximately) the value of x at a slightly later
time, by using the definition of ˙x. Similarly, if we know ˙x(t) and ¨x(t), then we
can easily find (approximately) the value of ˙x at a slightly later time, by using the
definition of ¨x. Using the definitions of the derivatives, the relations are simply

x(t + (cid:9)) ≈ x(t) + (cid:9) ˙x(t),
˙x(t + (cid:9)) ≈ ˙x(t) + (cid:9) ¨x(t).

(1.15)

These two equations, combined with (1.13), which gives us ¨x in terms of x, allow
us to march along in time, obtaining successive values for x, ˙x, and ¨x.4

Here’s what a typical program might look like.5 (This is a Maple program, but
even if you aren’t familiar with this, the general idea should be clear.) Let’s say

4 Of course, another expression for ¨x is the definitional one, analogous to Eqs. (1.15), involving
the third derivative. But this would then require knowledge of the third derivative, and so on with
higher derivatives, and we would end up with an infinite chain of relations. An equation of motion
such as Eq. (1.13) (which in general could be an F = ma, τ = I α, or Euler–Lagrange equation)
relates ¨x back to x (and possibly ˙x), thereby creating an intertwined relation among x, ˙x, and ¨x, and
eliminating the need for an infinite and useless chain.

5 We’ve written the program in the most straightforward way, without any concern for efficiency,
because computing time isn’t an issue in this simple system. But in more complex systems that
require programs for which computing time is an issue, a major part of the problem-solving process
is developing a program that is as efficient as possible.

1.4 Solving differential equations numerically

that the particle starts from rest at position x = 2, and let’s pick ω2 = 5. We’ll
use the notation where x1 stands for ˙x, and x2 stands for ¨x. And e stands for (cid:9).
Let’s calculate x at, say, t = 3.

# initial position
# initial velocity
# small time interval

x:=2:
x1:=0:
e:=.01:
for i to 300 do # do 300 steps (ie, up to 3 seconds)
# the given equation
x2:=-5*x:
# how x changes, by definition of x1
x:=x+e*x1:
# how x1 changes, by definition of x2
x1:=x1+e*x2:
# the Maple command to stop the do loop
end do:
# print the value of x
x;

This procedure won’t give the exact value for x, because x and ˙x don’t really
change according to Eqs. (1.15). These equations are just first-order approxi-
mations to the full Taylor series with higher-order terms. Said differently, there
is no way the above procedure can be exactly correct, because there are ambi-
guities in how the program can be written. Should line 5 come before or after
line 7? That is, in determining ˙x at time t + (cid:9), should we use the ¨x at time t or
t + (cid:9)? And should line 7 come before or after line 6? The point is that for very
small (cid:9), the order doesn’t matter much. And in the limit (cid:9) → 0, the order doesn’t
matter at all.

If we want to obtain a better approximation, we can just shorten (cid:9) down to
0.001 and increase the number of steps to 3000. If the result looks basically the
same as with (cid:9) = 0.01, then we know we pretty much have the right answer. In the
present example, (cid:9) = 0.01 yields x ≈ 1.965 after 3 seconds. If we set (cid:9) = 0.001,
then we obtain x ≈ 1.836. And if we set (cid:9) = 0.0001, then we get x ≈ 1.823.
The correct answer must therefore be somewhere around x = 1.82. And indeed,
if we solve the problem exactly, we obtain x(t) = 2 cos(
5 t). Plugging in t = 3
gives x ≈ 1.822.

√

This is a wonderful procedure, but it shouldn’t be abused. It’s nice to know that
we can always obtain a decent numerical approximation if all else fails. But we
should set our initial goal on obtaining the correct algebraic expression, because
this allows us to see the overall behavior of the system. And besides, nothing
beats the truth. People tend to rely a bit too much on computers and calculators
nowadays, without pausing to think about what is actually going on in a problem.

1.1. Escape velocity *

√

As given below in Exercise 1.9, show that the escape velocity from the
2GME/R, up to numerical factors. You can use the fact
earth is v =
that the form of Newton’s gravitation force law implies that the accel-
eration (and hence overall motion) of the particle doesn’t depend on
its mass.

1.2. Mass in a tube *

A tube of mass M and length (cid:2) is free to swing around a pivot at one end.
A mass m is positioned inside the (frictionless) tube at this end. The tube
is held horizontal and then released (see Fig. 1.5). Let η be the fraction of
the tube that the mass has traversed by the time the tube becomes vertical.
Does η depend on (cid:2)?

1.4. Vibrating star *

Consider a vibrating star, whose frequency ν depends (at most) on its
radius R, mass density ρ, and Newton’s gravitational constant G. How
does ν depend on R, ρ, and G?

1.5. Damping **

A particle with mass m and initial speed V is subject to a velocity-
dependent damping force of the form bvn.

(a) For n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , determine how the stopping time depends on

m, V , and b.

(b) For n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , determine how the stopping distance depends

on m, V , and b.

Be careful! See if your answers make sense. Dimensional analysis gives
the answer only up to a numerical factor. This is a tricky problem, so don’t
let it discourage you from using dimensional analysis. Most applications
of dimensional analysis are quite straightforward.

Two equal masses are connected by a string that hangs over two pulleys

line, but the right mass is free to swing back and forth in the plane of the
masses and pulleys. It can be shown (see Problem 6.4) that the equations

2π
(cid:2)/g for a pendulum). It also happens to be about 1.31 times the

1.18. Distance with damping **

A mass is subject to a damping force proportional to its velocity, which
means that the equation of motion takes the form ¨x = −A˙x, where A is
some constant. If the initial speed is 2 m/s, and if A = 1 s−1, how far has
the mass traveled at 1 s? 10 s? 100 s? You should find that the distance
approaches a limiting value.

Now assume that the mass is subject to a damping force proportional
to the square of its velocity, which means that the equation of motion
now takes the form ¨x = −A˙x2, where A is some constant. If the initial
speed is 2 m/s, and if A = 1 m−1, how far has the mass traveled at 1 s?
10 s? 100 s? How about some larger powers of 10? You should find that
the distance keeps growing, but slowly like the log of t. (The results
for these two forms of the damping are consistent with the results of
Problem 1.5.)

1.7 Solutions

1.1. Escape velocity

√

√

√

It is tempting to use the same reasoning as in the low-orbit satellite example in Section
1.2. This reasoning gives the same result, v = C
GME/R, where C is some
number (it turns out that C =
2). Although this solution yields the correct answer, it
isn’t quite rigorous, in view of the footnote in the low-orbit satellite example. Because
the particle isn’t always at the same radius, the force changes, so it isn’t obvious that we
can absorb the ME and G dependence into one quantity, g, as we did with the orbiting
satellite. Let us therefore be more rigorous with the following reasoning.

gR = C

The dimensionful quantities in the problem are [m] = M , the radius of the earth
the mass of the earth [ME] = M , and Newton’s gravitational con-
[R] = L,
stant [G] = L3/MT 2. These units for G follow from the gravitational force law,
F = Gm1m2/r2. If we use no information other than these given quantities, then there
GME/R, because for all we know, there could be a
is no way to arrive at the speed of C
factor of (m/ME)7 in the answer. This number is dimensionless, so it wouldn’t mess up
the units.

√

If we want to make any progress in this problem, we have to use the fact that the
gravitational force takes the form of GMEm/r2. This then implies (as was stated in the
problem) that the acceleration is independent of m. And since the path of the particle is
determined by its acceleration, we see that the answer can’t depend on m. We are there-
fore left with the quantities G, R, and ME, and you can show that the only combination
of these quantities that gives the units of speed is v = C

GME/R.

√

1.2. Mass in a tube

The dimensionful quantities are [g] = L/T 2, [(cid:2)] = L, [m] = M , and [M ] = M . We
want to produce a dimensionless number η. Since g is the only constant involving time,
η cannot depend on g. This then implies that η cannot depend on (cid:2), which is the only

1.7 Solutions

19

length remaining. Therefore, η depends only on m and M (and furthermore only on the
ratio m/M , since we want a dimensionless number). So the answer to the stated problem
is, “No.”

It turns out that you have to solve the problem numerically if you actually want to
find η (see Problem 8.5). Some results are: If m (cid:4) M , then η ≈ 0.349. If m = M , then
η ≈ 0.378. And if m = 2M , then η ≈ 0.410.

1.3. Waves in a fluid

We want to make a speed, [v] = L/T , out of the quantities [ρ] = M /L3, and [B] =
[F/A] = (ML/T 2)/(L2) = M /(LT 2). We can play around with these quantities to find
the combination that has the correct units, but let’s do it the no-fail way. If v ∝ ρaBb,
then we have

(1.21)

M : 0 = a + b,

Matching up the powers of the three kinds of units on each side of this equation gives
L : 1 = −3a − b,
(1.22)
The solution to this system of equations is a = −1/2 and b = 1/2. Therefore, our
answer is v ∝
B/ρ. Fortunately, there was a solution to this system of three equations
in two unknowns.

T : −1 = −2b.

√

1.4. Vibrating star

We want to make a frequency, [ν] = 1/T , out of the quantities [R] = L, [ρ] = M /L3,
and [G] = L3/(MT 2). These units for G follow from the gravitational force law, F =
Gm1m2/r2. As in the previous problem, we can play around with these quantities to find
the combination that has the correct units, but let’s do it the no-fail way. If ν ∝ RaρbGc,
then we have

(1.23)

Matching up the powers of the three kinds of units on each side of this equation gives
L : 0 = a − 3b + 3c,
(1.24)
The solution to this system of equations is a = 0, and b = c = 1/2. Therefore, our
answer is ν ∝

ρG. So it turns out that there is no R dependence.

T : −1 = −2c.

M : 0 = b − c,

√

Remark: Note the difference in the given quantities in this problem (R, ρ, and G)
and the ones in Exercise 1.12 (R, ρ, and S). In this problem with the star, the mass
is large enough so that we can ignore the surface tension, S. And in Exercise 1.12
with the drop, the mass is small enough so that we can ignore the gravitational force,
and hence G. ♣

1.5. Damping

(a) The constant b has units [b] = [Force][v−n] = (ML/T 2)(T n/Ln). The other
quantities are [m] = M and [V ] = L/T . There is also n, which is dimen-
sionless. You can show that the only combination of these quantities that has
units of T is

t = f (n) m
where f (n) is a dimensionless function of n.

bV n−1 ,

(1.25)

For n = 0, we have t = f (0) mV /b. This increases with m and V , and decreases

with b, as it should.

For n = 1, we have t = f (1) m/b. So we seem to have t ∼ m/b. This, however,
cannot be correct, because t should definitely grow with V . A large initial speed
V1 requires some nonzero time to slow down to a smaller speed V2, after which
time we simply have the same scenario with initial speed V2. So where did we go
wrong? After all, dimensional analysis tells us that the answer does have to look
like t = f (1) m/b, where f (1) is a numerical factor. The resolution to this puzzle

20

Strategies for solving problems

is that f (1) is infinite. If we worked out the problem using F = ma, we would
encounter an integral that diverges. So for any V , we would find an infinite t. 6
Similarly, for n ≥ 2, there is at least one power of V in the denominator of t.
This certainly cannot be correct, because t should not decrease with V . So f (n)
must likewise be infinite for all of these cases.

The moral of this exercise is that sometimes you have to be careful when
using dimensional analysis. The numerical factor in front of your answer
nearly always turns out to be of order 1, but in some strange cases it turns
out to be 0 or ∞.

Remark: For n ≥ 1, the expression in Eq. (1.25) still has relevance. For example,
for n = 2, the m/(Vb) expression is relevant if you want to know how long it
takes to go from V to some final speed Vf . The answer involves m/(Vf b), which
diverges as Vf → 0. ♣

(b) You can show that the only combination of the quantities that has units of L is
(cid:2) = g(n) m
where g(n) is a dimensionless function of n.

bV n−2 ,

(1.26)

For n = 0, we have (cid:2) = g(0) mV 2/b. This increases with V , as it should.
For n = 1, we have (cid:2) = g(1) mV /b. This increases with V , as it should.
For n = 2 we have (cid:2) = g(2) m/b. So we seem to have (cid:2) ∼ m/b. But as in
part (a), this cannot be correct, because (cid:2) should definitely depend on V . A large
initial speed V1 requires some nonzero distance to slow down to a smaller speed
V2, after which point we simply have the same scenario with initial speed V2. So,
from the reasoning in part (a), the total distance is infinite for n ≥ 2, because the
function g is infinite.

Remark: Note that for integral n (cid:13)= 1, t and (cid:2) are either both finite or both
infinite. For n = 1, however, the total time is infinite, whereas the total distance
is finite. This situation actually holds for 1 ≤ n < 2, if we want to consider
fractional n. ♣

then t grows with V .

1.7. Two masses, one swinging

As in Section 1.4, we’ll write a Maple program. We’ll let q stand for θ , and we’ll use
the notation where q1 stands for ˙θ, and q2 stands for ¨θ . Likewise for r. We’ll run the
program for as long as r < 2. As soon as r exceeds 2, the program will stop and print
the value of the time.

# initial r value
# initial r velocity
# initial angle
# initial angular velocity

# the second of the given eqs
# how q changes, by definition of q1
# how q1 changes, by definition of q2
# the Maple command to stop the do loop
# print the value of the time

This yields a time of t = 8.057 s. If we instead use a time interval of 0.0001 s, we obtain
t = 8.1377 s. And a time interval of 0.00001 s gives t = 8.14591 s. So the correct time
must be somewhere around 8.15 s.

Chapter 2
Statics

The subject of statics often appears in later chapters in other books, after force
and torque have been discussed. However, the way that force and torque are
used in statics problems is fairly minimal, at least compared with what we’ll
be doing later in this book. Therefore, since we won’t be needing much of the
machinery that we’ll be developing later on, I’ll introduce here the bare min-
imum of force and torque concepts necessary for statics problems. This will
open up a whole class of problems for us. But even though the underlying
principles of statics are quick to state, statics problems can be unexpect-
edly tricky. So be sure to tackle a lot of them to make sure you understand
things.

2.1 Balancing forces

A “static” setup is one where all the objects are motionless. If an object remains
motionless, then Newton’s second law, F = ma (which we’ll discuss in great
detail in the next chapter), tells us that the total external force acting on the object
must be zero. The converse is not true, of course. The total external force on an
object is also zero if it moves with constant nonzero velocity. But we’ll deal only
with statics problems here. The whole goal in a statics problem is to find out what
the various forces have to be so that there is zero net force acting on each object
(and zero net torque, too, but that’s the topic of Section 2.2). Because a force is
a vector, this goal involves breaking the force up into its components. You can
pick Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, or another set. It is usually clear
from the problem which system will make your calculations easiest. Once you
pick a system, you simply have to demand that the total external force in each
direction is zero.

There are many different types of forces in the world, most of which are large-
scale effects of complicated things going on at smaller scales. For example, the
tension in a rope comes from the chemical bonds that hold the molecules in
the rope together, and these chemical forces are electrical forces. In doing a
mechanics problem involving a rope, there is certainly no need to analyze all the
details of the forces taking place at the molecular scale. You just call the force in

22

2.1 Balancing forces

23

the rope a “tension” and get on with the problem. Four types of forces come up
repeatedly:

Tension
Tension is the general name for a force that a rope, stick, etc., exerts when it
is pulled on. Every piece of the rope feels a tension force in both directions,
except the end points, which feel a tension on one side and a force on the other
side from whatever object is attached to the end. In some cases, the tension may
vary along the rope. The “Rope wrapped around a pole” example at the end of
this section is a good illustration of this. In other cases, the tension must be the
same everywhere. For example, in a hanging massless rope, or in a massless
rope hanging over a frictionless pulley, the tension must be the same at all points,
because otherwise there would be a net force on at least some part of the rope,
and then F = ma would yield an infinite acceleration for this (massless) piece.

Normal force
This is the force perpendicular to a surface that the surface applies to an object.
The total force applied by a surface is usually a combination of the normal force
and the friction force (see below). But for frictionless surfaces such as greasy
ones or ice, only the normal force exists. The normal force comes about because
the surface actually compresses a tiny bit and acts like a very rigid spring. The
surface gets squashed until the restoring force equals the force necessary to keep
the object from squashing in any more.

For the most part, the only difference between a “tension” and a “normal
force” is the direction of the force. Both situations can be modeled by a spring.
In the case of a tension, the spring (a rope, a stick, or whatever) is stretched,
and the force on the given object is directed toward the spring. In the case of
a normal force, the spring is compressed, and the force on the given object is
directed away from the spring. Things like sticks can provide both normal forces
and tensions. But a rope, for example, has a hard time providing a normal force.
In practice, in the case of elongated objects such as sticks, a compressive force
is usually called a “compressive tension,” or a “negative tension,” instead of a
normal force. So by these definitions, a tension can point either way. At any rate,
it’s just semantics. If you use any of these descriptions for a compressed stick,
people will know what you mean.

Friction
Friction is the force parallel to a surface that a surface applies to an object.
Some surfaces, such as sandpaper, have a great deal of friction. Some, such as
greasy ones, have essentially no friction. There are two types of friction, called
“kinetic” friction and “static” friction. Kinetic friction (which we won’t cover in
this chapter) deals with two objects moving relative to each other. It is usually
a good approximation to say that the kinetic friction between two objects is

24

Statics

proportional to the normal force between them. The constant of proportionality
is called µk (the “coefficient of kinetic friction”), where µk depends on the two
surfaces involved. Thus, F = µkN , where N is the normal force. The direction
of the force is opposite to the motion.

Static friction deals with two objects at rest relative to each other. In the static
case, we have F ≤ µsN (where µs is the “coefficient of static friction”). Note
the inequality sign. All we can say prior to solving a problem is that the static
friction force has a maximum value equal to Fmax = µsN . In a given problem,
it is most likely less than this. For example, if a block of large mass M sits on a
surface with coefficient of friction µs, and you give the block a tiny push to the
right (tiny enough so that it doesn’t move), then the friction force is of course not
equal to µsN = µsMg to the left. Such a force would send the block sailing off
to the left. The true friction force is simply equal and opposite to the tiny force
you apply. What the coefficient µs tells us is that if you apply a force larger than
µsMg (the maximum friction force on a horizontal table), then the block will end
up moving to the right.

Gravity
Consider two point objects, with masses M and m, separated by a distance R.
Newton’s gravitational force law says that the force between these objects is
attractive and has magnitude F = GMm/R2, where G = 6.67·10−11 m3/(kg s2).
As we’ll show in Chapter 5, the same law also applies to spheres of nonzero size.
That is, a sphere may be treated like a point mass located at its center. Therefore,

where M is the mass of the earth, and R is its radius. This equation defines g.
Plugging in the numerical values, we obtain g ≈ 9.8 m/s2, as you can check.
Every object on the surface of the earth feels a force of mg downward (g varies
slightly over the surface of the earth, but let’s ignore this). If the object is not
accelerating, then there must be other forces present (normal forces, etc.) to make
the total force be equal to zero.

Another common force is the Hooke’s-law spring force, F = −kx. But we’ll
postpone the discussion of springs until Chapter 4, where we’ll spend a whole
chapter on them in depth.

Example (Block on a plane): A block of mass M rests on a fixed plane inclined
at an angle θ . You apply a horizontal force of Mg on the block, as shown in Fig. 2.1.
Assume that the friction force between the block and the plane is large enough to keep
the block at rest. What are the normal and friction forces (call them N and Ff ) that
the plane exerts on the block? If the coefficient of static friction is µ, for what range
of angles θ will the block in fact remain at rest?

Solution: Let’s break the forces up into components parallel and perpendicular
to the plane. (The horizontal and vertical components would also work, but the
calculation would be a little longer.) The forces are N , Ff , the applied Mg, and
the weight Mg, as shown in Fig. 2.2. Balancing the forces parallel and perpen-
dicular to the plane gives, respectively (with upward along the plane taken to be
positive),

Ff = Mg sin θ − Mg cos θ,
N = Mg cos θ + Mg sin θ.

(2.2)

Intermediate remarks:

√

1. If tan θ > 1, then Ff is positive (that is, it points up the plane). And if tan θ < 1, then
Ff is negative (that is, it points down the plane). There is no need to worry about
which way it points when drawing the diagram. Just pick a direction to be positive,
and if Ff comes out to be negative (as it does in the figure above, because θ < 45◦),
then it actually points in the other direction.

2. Ff ranges from −Mg to Mg as θ ranges from 0 to π/2 (convince yourself that these
limiting values make sense). As an exercise, you can show that N is maximum when
2Mg and Ff = 0.
tan θ = 1, in which case N =
3. The sin θ and cos θ factors in Eq. (2.2) follow from the angles θ drawn in Fig. 2.2.
However, when solving problems like this one, it’s easy to make a mistake in the
geometry and then label an angle as θ when it really should be 90◦ − θ . So two
pieces of advice: (1) Never draw an angle close to 45◦ in a figure, because if you do,
you won’t be able to tell the θ angles from the 90◦ − θ ones. (2) Always check your
results by letting θ go to 0 or 90◦ (in other words, does virtually all of a force, or
virtually none of it, act in a certain direction when the plane is, say, horizontal). Once
you do this a few times, you’ll realize that you probably don’t even need to work out
the geometry in the first place. Since you know that any given component is going
to involve either sin θ or cos θ, you can just pick the one that works correctly in a
certain limit. ♣

The coefficient µ tells us that |Ff | ≤ µN . Using Eq. (2.2), this inequality becomes

Mg| sin θ − cos θ | ≤ µMg(cos θ + sin θ).

(2.3)

The absolute value here signifies that we must consider two cases:

• If tan θ ≥ 1, then Eq. (2.3) becomes

sin θ − cos θ ≤ µ(cos θ + sin θ ) =⇒ tan θ ≤ 1 + µ
1 − µ .

(2.4)

We divided by 1 − µ, so this inequality is valid only if µ < 1. But if µ ≥ 1, we
see from the first inequality here that any value of θ (subject to our assumption,
tan θ ≥ 1) works.

• If tan θ ≤ 1, then Eq. (2.3) becomes

− sin θ + cos θ ≤ µ(cos θ + sin θ ) =⇒ tan θ ≥ 1 − µ
1 + µ .

(2.5)

26

Statics

Putting these two ranges for θ together, we have

1 − µ
1 + µ

≤ tan θ ≤ 1 + µ
1 − µ .

(2.6)

Remarks: For very small µ, these bounds both approach 1, which means that θ must be
very close to 45◦. This makes sense. If there is very little friction, then the components
along the plane of the horizontal and vertical Mg forces must nearly cancel; hence, θ ≈ 45◦.
A special value for µ is 1, because from Eq. (2.6), we see that µ = 1 is the cutoff value
that allows θ to reach both 0 and π/2. If µ ≥ 1, then any tilt of the plane is allowed. We’ve
been assuming throughout this example that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. The task of Exercise 2.20 is to
deal with the case where θ > π/2, where the block is under an overhang. ♣

Let’s now do an example involving a rope in which the tension varies with
position. We’ll need to consider differential pieces of the rope to solve this
problem.

Example (Rope wrapped around a pole): A rope wraps an angle θ around a
pole. You grab one end and pull with a tension T0. The other end is attached to a large
object, say, a boat. If the coefficient of static friction between the rope and the pole
is µ, what is the largest force the rope can exert on the boat, if the rope is not to slip
around the pole?

Solution: Consider a small piece of the rope that subtends an angle dθ. Let the
tension in this piece be T (which varies slightly over the small length). As shown in
Fig. 2.3, the pole exerts a small outward normal force, Ndθ , on the piece. This normal
force exists to balance the “inward” components of the tensions at the ends. These
inward components have magnitude T sin(dθ/2).1 Therefore, Ndθ = 2T sin(dθ/2).
The small-angle approximation, sin x ≈ x, allows us to write this as Ndθ = T dθ.

The friction force on the little piece of rope satisfies Fdθ ≤ µNdθ = µT dθ. This
friction force is what gives rise to the difference in tension between the two ends of
the piece. In other words, the tension, as a function of θ, satisfies

T (θ + dθ) ≤ T (θ) + µT dθ

1 One of them actually has magnitude (T + dT ) sin(dθ/2), where dT is the increase in tension along
the small piece. But the extra term this produces, (dT ) sin(dθ/2), is a second-order small quantity,
so it can be ignored.

where we have used the fact that T = T0 when θ = 0. The exponential behavior
here is quite strong (as exponential behaviors tend to be). If we let µ = 1, then just a
π/2 ≈ 5. One full revolution yields
quarter turn around the pole produces a factor of e
a factor of e2π ≈ 530, and two full revolutions yield a factor of e4π ≈ 300 000.
Needless to say, the limiting factor in such a case is not your strength, but rather the
structural integrity of the pole around which the rope winds.

2.2 Balancing torques

In addition to balancing forces in a statics problem, we must also balance torques.
We’ll have much more to say about torque in Chapters 8 and 9, but we’ll need
one important fact here. Consider the situation in Fig. 2.4, where three forces
are applied perpendicular to a stick, which is assumed to remain motionless. F1
and F2 are the forces at the ends, and F3 is the force in the interior. We have, of
course, F3 = F1 + F2, because the stick is at rest. But we also have the following
relation:

Claim 2.1 If the system is motionless, then F3a = F2(a + b). In other words,
the torques (force times distance) around the left end cancel.2 And you can show
that they cancel around any other point, too.

We’ll prove this claim in Chapter 8 by using angular momentum, but let’s give a
short proof here.

Proof: We’ll make one reasonable assumption, namely,
relationship between the forces and distances is of the form,

that the correct

F3f (a) = F2f (a + b),

(2.8)

where f (x) is a function to be determined.3 Applying this assumption with the
roles of “left” and “right” reversed in Fig. 2.4 gives

F3f (b) = F1f (a + b).

Adding Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9), and using F3 = F1 + F2, yields

f (a) + f (b) = f (a + b).

(2.9)

(2.10)

This equation implies that f (rx) = rf (x) for any x and for any rational number
r, as you can show (see Exercise 2.28). Therefore, assuming f (x) is continuous,

2 Another proof of this claim is given in Problem 2.11.
3 What we’re doing here is simply assuming linearity in F. That is, two forces of F applied at a point

should be the same as a force of 2F applied at that point. You can’t really argue with that.

it must be a linear function, f (x) = Ax, as we wanted to show. The constant A is
irrelevant, because it cancels in Eq. (2.8). (cid:1)

Note that dividing Eq. (2.8) by Eq. (2.9) gives F1f (a) = F2f (b), and hence
F1a = F2b, which says that the torques cancel around the point where F3 is
applied. You can show that the torques cancel around any arbitrary pivot point.
When adding up all the torques in a given physical setup, it is of course required
that you use the same pivot point when calculating each torque.

In the case where the forces aren’t perpendicular to the stick, the above claim
applies to the components of the forces perpendicular to the stick. This makes
sense, because the components parallel to the stick have no effect on the rotation
of the stick around the pivot point. Therefore, referring to Figs. 2.5 and 2.6, the
equality of the torques can be written as

Faa sin θa = Fbb sin θb.

(2.11)

This equation can be viewed in two ways:

• (Fa sin θa)a = (Fb sin θb)b. In other words, we effectively have smaller forces acting

on the given “lever arms,” as shown in Fig. 2.5.

• Fa(a sin θa) = Fb(b sin θb). In other words, we effectively have the given forces acting

on smaller “lever arms,” as shown in Fig. 2.6.

Claim 2.1 shows that even if you apply only a tiny force, you can balance
the torque due to a very large force, provided that you make your lever arm
sufficiently long. This fact led a well-known mathematician of long ago to claim
that he could move the earth if given a long enough lever arm.

One morning while eating my Wheaties,
I felt the earth move ‘neath my feeties.
The cause for alarm
Was a long lever arm,
At the end of which grinned Archimedes!

One handy fact that comes up often is that the gravitational torque on a
stick of mass M is the same as the gravitational torque due to a point-mass
M located at the center of the stick. The truth of this statement relies on the fact
that torque is a linear function of the distance to the pivot point (see Exercise
2.27). More generally, the gravitational torque on an object of mass M may be
treated simply as the gravitational torque due to a force Mg located at the center
of mass.

We’ll talk more about torque in Chapters 8 and 9, but for now we’ll just
use the fact that in a statics problem the torques around any given point must
balance.

2.2 Balancing torques

29

Example (Leaning ladder): A ladder leans against a frictionless wall. If the
coefficient of friction with the ground is µ, what is the smallest angle the ladder can
make with the ground and not slip?

Solution: Let the ladder have mass m and length (cid:2). As shown in Fig. 2.7, we have
three unknown forces: the friction force F, and the normal forces N1 and N2. And
to solve for these three forces we fortunately have three equations: (cid:13)Fvert = 0,
(cid:13)Fhoriz = 0, and (cid:13)τ = 0 (τ is the standard symbol for torque). Looking at the
vertical forces, we see that N1 = mg. And then looking at the horizontal forces, we
see that N2 = F. So we have quickly reduced the unknowns from three to one.

We will now use (cid:13)τ = 0 to find N2 (or F). But first we must pick the “pivot” point
around which we will calculate the torques. Any stationary point will work fine, but
certain choices make the calculation easier than others. The best choice for the pivot
is generally the point at which the most forces act, because then the (cid:13)τ = 0 equation
will have the smallest number of terms in it (because a force provides no torque around
the point where it acts, since the lever arm is zero). In this problem, there are two
forces acting at the bottom end of the ladder, so this is the point we’ll choose for the
pivot (but you should verify that other choices for the pivot, for example, the middle
or top of the ladder, give the same result). Balancing the torques due to gravity and
N2, we have

N2(cid:2) sin θ = mg((cid:2)/2) cos θ =⇒ N2 = mg

2 tan θ .

(2.12)

This is also the value of the friction force F. The condition F ≤ µN1 = µmg
therefore becomes

mg
2 tan θ

≤ µmg =⇒ tan θ ≥ 1

2µ .

(2.13)

Remarks: Note that the total force exerted on the ladder by the floor points up at an angle
given by tan β = N1/F = (mg)/(mg/2 tan θ) = 2 tan θ . We see that this force does not
point along the ladder. There is simply no reason why it should. But there is a nice reason
why it should point upward with twice the slope of the ladder. This is the direction that
causes the lines of the three forces on the ladder to be concurrent (that is, pass through a
common point), as shown in Fig. 2.8. This concurrency is a neat little theorem for statics
problems involving three forces. The proof is simple. If the three lines weren’t concurrent,
then one force would produce a nonzero torque around the intersection point of the other
two lines of force.4

This theorem provides a quick way to solve the ladder problem in the more general
case where the center of mass is a fraction f of the way up. In this case, the concurrency
theorem tells us that the slope of the total force from the floor is (1/f ) tan θ , consistent
with the f = 1/2 result from above. The vertical component is still mg, so the horizontal
(friction) component is now fmg/ tan θ. Demanding that this be less than or equal to
µmg gives tan θ ≥ f /µ, consistent with the f = 1/2 result. Since this result depends

4 The one exception to this reasoning is where no two of the lines intersect, that is, where all three
lines are parallel. Equilibrium is certainly possible in such a scenario, as we saw in Claim 2.1. But
you can hang on to the concurrency theorem in this case if you consider the parallel lines to meet
at infinity.

only on the location of the center of mass, and not on the exact distribution of mass, a
corollary is that if you climb up a ladder (resting on a frictionless wall), your presence
makes the ladder more likely to slip if you are above the center of mass (because you have
raised the center of mass of the entire system and thus increased f ), and less likely if you
are below. ♣

The examples we’ve done in this chapter have consisted of only one object.
But many problems involve more than one object (as you’ll find in the problems
and exercises for this chapter), and there’s one additional fact you’ll often need to
invoke for these, namely Newton’s third law. This states that the force that object
A exerts on object B is equal and opposite to the force that B exerts on A (we’ll
talk more about Newton’s laws in Chapter 3). So if you want to find, say, the
normal force between two objects, you might be able to figure it out by looking
at forces and torques on either object, depending on how much you already know
about the other forces acting on each. Once you’ve found the force by dealing
with, say, object A, you can then use the equal and opposite force to help figure
out things about B. Depending on the problem, one object is often more useful
than the other to use first.

Note, however, that if you pick your subsystem (on which you’re going to
consider forces and torques) to include both A and B, then this won’t tell you
anything at all about the normal force (or friction) between them. This is true
because the normal force is an internal force between the objects (when consid-
ered together as a system), whereas only external forces are relevant in calculating
the total force and torque on the system (because all the internal forces cancel in
pairs, by Newton’s third law). The only way to determine a given force is to deal
with it as an external force on some subsystem(s).

Statics problems often involve a number of decisions. If there are various parts
to the system, then you must decide which subsystems you want to balance the
external forces and torques on. And furthermore, you must decide which point to
use as the origin for calculating the torques. There are invariably many choices
that will give you the information you need, but some will make your calculations
much cleaner than others (Exercise 2.35 is a good example of this). The only way
to know how to choose wisely is to start solving problems, so you may as well
tackle some . . .

in Fig. 2.16. At the bottom of the mountain are two stores. One sells
“cheap” lassos (made of a segment of rope tied to a loop of fixed
length); see Fig. 2.17. The other sells “deluxe” lassos (made of one
piece of rope with a loop of variable length; the loop’s length may
change without any friction of the rope with itself). When viewed from
the side, the conical mountain has an angle α at its peak. For what
angles α can the climber climb up along the mountain if he uses a
“cheap” lasso? A “deluxe” lasso? (Hint: The answer in the “cheap” case
isn’t α < 90◦.)

2.3 Problems

Section 2.2: Balancing torques

2.11. Equality of torques **

This problem gives another way of demonstrating Claim 2.1, using an
inductive argument. We’ll get you started, and then you can do the
general case.

Consider the situation where forces F are applied upward at the ends
of a stick of length (cid:2), and a force 2F is applied downward at the midpoint
(see Fig. 2.18). The stick doesn’t rotate (by symmetry), and it doesn’t
translate (because the net force is zero). If we wish, we may consider
the stick to have a pivot at the left end. If we then erase the force F on
the right end and replace it with a force 2F at the middle, then the two
2F forces in the middle cancel, so the stick remains at rest.5 Therefore,
we see that a force F applied at a distance (cid:2) from a pivot is equivalent
to a force 2F applied at a distance (cid:2)/2 from the pivot, in the sense that
they both have the same effect in canceling out the rotational effect of
the downwards 2F force.

Now consider the situation where forces F are applied upward at the
ends, and forces F are applied downward at the (cid:2)/3 and 2(cid:2)/3 marks
(see Fig. 2.19). The stick doesn’t rotate (by symmetry), and it doesn’t
translate (because the net force is zero). Consider the stick to have a
pivot at the left end. From the above paragraph, the force F at 2(cid:2)/3
is equivalent to a force 2F at (cid:2)/3. Making this replacement, we now
have a total force of 3F at the (cid:2)/3 mark. Therefore, we see that a
force F applied at a distance (cid:2) is equivalent to a force 3F applied at a
distance (cid:2)/3.

Your task is to now use induction to show that a force F applied at a
distance (cid:2) is equivalent to a force nF applied at a distance (cid:2)/n, and to
then argue why this demonstrates Claim 2.1.

One stick leans on another as shown in Fig. 2.21. A right angle is formed
where they meet, and the right stick makes an angle θ with the horizontal.
The left stick extends infinitesimally beyond the end of the right stick.
The coefficient of friction between the two sticks is µ. The sticks have

What is the minimum angle θ for which the sticks don’t fall?

A ladder of length L and mass M has its bottom end attached to the
ground by a pivot. It makes an angle θ with the horizontal and is held

pivot (see Fig. 2.22). The ladder and the stick are perpendicular to each
other. Find the force that the stick exerts on the ladder.

2.16. Balancing the stick **

Given a semi-infinite stick (that is, one that goes off to infinity in one
direction), determine how its density should depend on position so that it
has the following property: If the stick is cut at an arbitrary location, the
remaining semi-infinite piece will balance on a support that is located a
distance (cid:2) from the end (see Fig. 2.23).

A spool consists of an axle of radius r and an outside circle of radius R
which rolls on the ground. A thread is wrapped around the axle and is
pulled with tension T at an angle θ with the horizontal (see Fig. 2.24).
(a) Given R and r, what should θ be so that the spool doesn’t move?
Assume that the friction between the spool and the ground is large
enough so that the spool doesn’t slip.

(b) Given R, r, and the coefficient of friction µ between the spool
and the ground, what is the largest value of T for which the spool
remains at rest?

(c) Given R and µ, what should r be so that you can make the spool
slip from the static position with as small a T as possible? That
is, what should r be so that the upper bound on T in part (b) is as
small as possible? What is the resulting value of T ?

A stick of mass density per unit length ρ rests on a circle of radius R (see

to the circle at its upper end. Friction exists at all points of contact, and
assume that it is large enough to keep the system at rest. Find the friction

2.19. Leaning sticks and circles ***

A large number of sticks (with mass density per unit length ρ) and
circles (with radius R) lean on each other, as shown in Fig. 2.26. Each
stick makes an angle θ with the horizontal and is tangent to the next
circle at its upper end. The sticks are hinged to the ground, and every
other surface is frictionless (unlike in the previous problem). In the limit
of a very large number of sticks and circles, what is the normal force
between a stick and the circle it rests on, very far to the right? Assume
that the last circle leans against a wall, to keep it from moving.

A block of mass M is positioned underneath an overhang that makes an

are the normal and friction forces (call them N and Ff ) that the overhang

triangles of beams. Assume that the seven beams are massless and
that the connection between any two of them is a hinge. If a car
of mass m is located at the middle of the bridge, find the forces
(and specify tension or compression) in the beams. Assume that
the supports provide no horizontal forces on the bridge.

2.25. Rope between inclines **

A rope rests on two platforms that are both inclined at an angle θ (which
you are free to pick), as shown in Fig. 2.30. The rope has uniform mass
density, and the coefficient of friction between it and the platforms is 1.
The system has left-right symmetry. What is the largest possible fraction
of the rope that does not touch the platforms? What angle θ allows this
maximum fraction?

2.26. Hanging chain **

A chain with mass M hangs between two walls, with its ends at the
same height. The chain makes an angle θ with each wall, as shown in
Fig. 2.31. Find the tension in the chain at the lowest point. Solve this in
two different ways:

(a) Consider the forces on half of the chain. (This is the quick way.)
(b) Use the fact (see Problem 2.8) that the height of a hanging chain is
given by y(x) = (1/α) cosh(αx), and consider the vertical forces
on an infinitesimal piece at the bottom. This will give you the
tension in terms of α. Then find an expression for α in terms of
the given angle θ. (This is the long way.)

A ball is held up by a string, as shown in Fig. 2.32, with the string tangent
to the ball. If the angle between the string and the wall is θ, what is the

keeps the ball from falling?

Fig. 2.32

2.31. Cylinder and hanging mass *

A uniform cylinder of mass M sits on a fixed plane inclined at an
angle θ. A string is tied to the cylinder’s rightmost point, and a mass m
hangs from the string, as shown in Fig. 2.33. Assume that the coeffi-
cient of friction between the cylinder and the plane is sufficiently large
to prevent slipping. What is m, in terms of M and θ, if the setup is
static?

2.32. Ladder on a corner **

A ladder of mass M and length L leans against a frictionless wall, with
a quarter of its length hanging over a corner, as shown in Fig. 2.34. It
makes an angle θ with the horizontal. What angle θ requires the smallest
coefficient of friction at the corner to keep the ladder at rest? (Different
values of θ require different ladder lengths, but assume that the mass is
M for any length.)

2.33. Stick on a corner **

You support one end of a stick of mass M and length L with the tip of
your finger. A quarter of the way up the stick, it rests on a frictionless
corner of a table, as shown in Fig. 2.35. The stick makes an angle θ
with the horizontal. What is the magnitude of the force your finger must
apply to keep the stick in this position? For what angle θ does your force
point horizontally?

2.34. Stick and a cylinder **

A horizontal stick of mass m has its left end attached to a pivot on a plane
inclined at an angle θ, while its right end rests on the top of a cylinder
also of mass m which in turn rests on the plane, as shown in Fig. 2.36.

2.35. Two sticks and a string **

Two sticks, each of mass m and length (cid:2), are connected by a hinge at their
top ends. They each make an angle θ with the vertical. A massless string
connects the bottom of the left stick to the right stick, perpendicularly
as shown in Fig. 2.37. The whole setup stands on a frictionless table.

(a) What is the tension in the string?
(b) What force does the left stick exert on the right stick at the hinge?

Hint: No messy calculations required!

2.36. Two sticks and a wall **

Two sticks are connected, with hinges, to each other and to a wall. The
bottom stick is horizontal and has length L, and the sticks make an angle
of θ with each other, as shown in Fig. 2.38. If both sticks have the same
mass per unit length, ρ, find the horizontal and vertical components
of the force that the wall exerts on the top hinge, and show that the
magnitude goes to infinity for both θ → 0 and θ → π/2. 6

2.5 Solutions

2.1. Hanging rope

Let T (y) be the tension as a function of height. Consider a small piece of the rope
between y and y + dy (0 ≤ y ≤ L). The forces on this piece are T (y + dy) upward,
T (y) downward, and the weight ρg dy downward. Since the rope is at rest, we have
T (y + dy) = T (y) + ρg dy. Expanding this to first order in dy gives T (cid:16)(y) = ρg. The
tension in the bottom of the rope is zero, so integrating from y = 0 up to a position
y gives

T (y) = ρgy.

(2.16)

As a double-check, at the top end we have T (L) = ρgL, which is the weight of the
entire rope, as it should be.

Alternatively, you can simply write down the answer, T (y) = ρgy, by noting that
the tension at a given point in the rope is what supports the weight of all the rope
below it.

2.2. Block on a plane

Balancing the forces shown in Fig. 2.41, parallel and perpendicular to the plane, we
see that F = mg sin θ and N = mg cos θ. The horizontal components of these are
F cos θ = mg sin θ cos θ (to the right), and N sin θ = mg cos θ sin θ (to the left).
These are equal, as they must be, because the net horizontal force on the block is zero.
To maximize the value of mg sin θ cos θ, we can either take the derivative, or we can
write it as (mg/2) sin 2θ, from which it is clear that the maximum occurs at θ = π/4.
The maximum value is mg/2.

Statics

gravitational force, which is −Mg, and the vertical component of F, which is
F sin θ. If the book is to stay at rest, we must have F sin θ + Ff − Mg = 0.
Combining this with the condition Ff ≤ µF cos θ gives

Therefore, F must satisfy

F(sin θ + µ cos θ ) ≥ Mg.

F ≥

Mg
sin θ + µ cos θ ,

(2.18)

(2.19)

assuming that sin θ +µ cos θ is positive. If it is negative, then there is no solution
for F.

(b) To minimize this lower bound, we must maximize the denominator. Taking the
derivative gives cos θ − µ sin θ = 0, so tan θ = 1/µ. Plugging this value of θ
back into Eq. (2.19) gives

F ≥

mg(cid:4)

1 + µ2

(with tan θ = 1/µ).

(2.20)

This is the smallest possible F that keeps the book up, and the angle must be
θ = tan−1(1/µ) for it to work. We see that if µ is very small, then to minimize
your F, you should push essentially vertically with a force mg. But if µ is very
large, you should push essentially horizontally with a force mg/µ.

(c) There is no possible F that satisfies the condition in Eq. (2.19) if the right-hand
side is infinite (more precisely, there is no F that satisfies Eq. (2.18) if the
coefficient of F is zero or negative). This occurs when

tan θ = −µ.
(2.21)
If θ is more negative than this, then it is impossible to keep the book up, no
matter how hard you push.

2.5. Rope on a plane

The component of the gravitational force along the plane is (ρL)g sin θ , and the max-
imum value of the friction force is µN = µ(ρL)g cos θ . Therefore, you might think
that the tension at the top of the rope is ρLg sin θ − µρLg cos θ . However, this is
not necessarily the case. The tension at the top depends on how the rope is placed on
the plane. If, for example, the rope is placed on the plane without being stretched,
then the friction force points upwards, and the tension at the top does indeed equal
ρLg sin θ − µρLg cos θ . Or it equals zero if µρLg cos θ > ρLg sin θ , in which case
the friction force need not achieve its maximum value.

If, on the other hand, the rope is placed on the plane after being stretched (or
equivalently, it is dragged up along the plane and then nailed down at its top end),
then the friction force points downwards, and the tension at the top equals ρLg sin θ +
µρLg cos θ.

Another special case occurs when the rope is placed on a frictionless plane, and then
the coefficient of friction is “turned on” to µ. The friction force is still zero. Changing
the plane from ice to sandpaper (somehow without moving the rope) doesn’t suddenly
cause there to be a friction force. Therefore, the tension at the top equals ρLg sin θ .

In general, depending on how the rope is placed on the plane, the tension at the top
can take any value from a maximum of ρLg sin θ + µρLg cos θ , down to a minimum
of ρLg sin θ − µρLg cos θ (or zero, whichever is larger). If the rope is replaced by a
stick (which can support a compressive force), then the tension can achieve negative
values down to ρLg sin θ − µρLg cos θ , if this happens to be negative.

2.6. Supporting a disk

(a) The gravitational force downward on the disk is Mg, and the force upward is

2T . These forces must balance, so

T = Mg
2

.

(2.22)

2.5 Solutions

41

We can find the normal force per unit length that the string applies to the disk
in two ways.

First method: Let N dθ be the normal force on an arc of the disk that subtends
an angle dθ. Such an arc has length R dθ, so N /R is the desired normal force
per unit arclength. The tension in the string is the same throughout it, because
the string is massless. So all points are equivalent, and hence N is constant,
independent of θ. The upward component of the normal force is N dθ cos θ ,
where θ is measured from the vertical (that is, −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 here). Since
the total upward force is Mg, we must have

(cid:14) π/2

−π/2

N cos θ dθ = Mg.

(2.23)

The integral equals 2N , so we have N = Mg/2. The normal force per unit
length, N /R, therefore equals Mg/2R.

Second method: Consider the normal force, N dθ , on a small arc of the disk
that subtends an angle dθ. The tension forces on each end of the corresponding
small piece of string almost cancel, but they don’t exactly, because they point
in slightly different directions. Their nonzero sum is what produces the normal
force on the disk. From Fig. 2.43, we see that the two forces have a sum of
2T sin(dθ/2), directed “inward”. Since dθ is small, we can use sin x ≈ x to
approximate this as T dθ. Therefore, N dθ = T dθ , and so N = T . The normal
force per unit arclength, N /R, therefore equals T /R. Using T = Mg/2 from Eq.
(2.22), we arrive at N /R = Mg/2R.

(b) Let T (θ) be the tension, as a function of θ, for −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. T now
depends on θ, because there is a tangential friction force. Most of the work for
this problem was already done in the “Rope wrapped around a pole” example in
Section 2.1. We’ll simply invoke Eq. (2.7), which in the present language says9

T (θ) ≤ T (0)e

µθ

.

(2.24)

Letting θ = π/2, and using T (π/2) = Mg/2, gives Mg/2 ≤ T (0)eµπ/2. We
therefore see that the tension at the bottom point must satisfy

T (0) ≥ Mg
2

−µπ/2.

e

(2.25)

Remark: This minimum value of T (0) goes to Mg/2 as µ → 0, as it should.
And it goes to zero as µ → ∞, as it should (imagine a very rough surface, so
that the friction force from the rope near θ = π/2 accounts for essentially all the
weight). But interestingly, the tension at the bottom doesn’t exactly equal zero,
no matter now large µ is. Basically, the smaller T is, the smaller N is. But the
smaller N is, the smaller the change in T is (because N determines the friction
force). So T doesn’t decrease much when it’s small, and this results in it never
being able to reach zero. ♣

2.7. Objects between circles

(a) Let N be the normal force between the circles and the triangle. The goal in
this problem is to find the horizontal component of N , that is, N cos θ . From
Fig. 2.44, we see that the upward force on the triangle from the normal forces is
2N sin θ. This must equal the weight of the triangle, which is gσ times the area.
Since the bottom angle of the isosceles triangle is 2θ , the top side has length

Fig. 2.44

9 This holds for θ > 0. There would be a minus sign on the right-hand side if θ < 0. But since the
tension is symmetric around θ = 0 in the case we’re concerned with, we’ll just deal with θ > 0.

2L sin θ, and the altitude to this side is L cos θ . So the area of the triangle is
L2 sin θ cos θ . The mass is therefore σ L2 sin θ cos θ . Equating the weight with
the upward component of the normal forces gives N = (gσ L2/2) cos θ . The
horizontal component of N is therefore

N cos θ = gσ L2 cos2 θ
This equals zero when θ = π/2, and it increases as θ decreases, even though
the triangle is getting smaller. It has the interesting property of approaching the
finite value gσ L2/2, as θ → 0.

(2.26)

.

(b) In Fig. 2.45, the base of the rectangle has length 2R(1 − cos θ ). Its mass is
therefore 2σ RL(1 − cos θ ). Equating the weight with the upward component of
the normal forces, 2N sin θ , gives N = σ gRL(1 − cos θ )/ sin θ . The horizontal
component of N is therefore

N cos θ =

σ gRL(1 − cos θ ) cos θ
sin θ

.

(2.27)

This equals zero for both θ = π/2 and θ = 0 (because 1 − cos θ ≈ θ 2/2 goes
to zero faster than sin θ ≈ θ , for small θ ). Taking the derivative to find where it
reaches a maximum, we obtain (using sin2 θ = 1 − cos2 θ ),

cos3 θ − 2 cos θ + 1 = 0.
(2.28)
Fortunately, there is an easy root of this cubic equation, namely cos θ = 1,
which we know is not the maximum. Dividing through by the factor (cos θ − 1)
gives cos2 θ + cos θ − 1 = 0. The roots of this quadratic equation are

√

cos θ =

−1 ±

.

(2.29)

We must choose the plus sign, because we need | cos θ | ≤ 1. So our answer is
cos θ ≈ 0.618, which is the inverse of the golden ratio. The angle θ is ≈ 51.8◦.
(c) In Fig. 2.46, the length of the hypotenuse shown is R sec θ , so the radius of the
top circle is R(sec θ − 1). Its mass is therefore σ πR2(sec θ − 1)2. Equating
the weight with the upward component of the normal forces, 2N sin θ , gives
N = σ gπR2(sec θ − 1)2/(2 sin θ ). The horizontal component of N is therefore

This equals zero when θ = 0 (using cos θ ≈ 1 − θ 2/2 and sin θ ≈ θ , for
small θ). For θ → π/2, it behaves like 1/ cos θ , which goes to infinity. In this
limit, N points almost vertically, but its magnitude is so large that the horizontal
component still approaches infinity.

2.8. Hanging chain

(a) The key fact to note is that the horizontal component, Tx, of the tension is the
same throughout the chain. This is true because the net horizontal force on any
subpart of the chain must be zero. Label the constant value as Tx ≡ C.

Let the shape of the chain be described by the function y(x). Since the tension
points along the chain at all points (see Problem 2.12), its components satisfy
Ty/Tx = y(cid:16), which gives Ty = Cy(cid:16). In other words, Ty is proportional to the
slope of the chain.

Now consider a little piece of the chain, with endpoints at x and x + dx, as
shown in Fig. 2.47. The difference in the Ty values at the endpoints is what
balances the weight of the little piece, (dm)g. The length of the piece is ds =

−1 z = α(x + a) =⇒ z = sinh α(x + a).

(2.33)

Recalling that z ≡ dy/dx, we can integrate again to obtain
y(x) = 1

α cosh α(x + a) + h.

(2.34)

The shape of the chain is therefore a hyperbolic cosine function. The constant
h isn’t too important, because it depends simply on where we pick the y = 0
height. Furthermore, we can eliminate the need for the constant a if we pick
x = 0 to be where the lowest point of the chain is (or where it would be, in the
case where the slope is always nonzero). In this case, using Eq. (2.34), we see
that y(cid:16)(0) = 0 implies a = 0, as desired. We then have (ignoring the constant h)
the nice simple result,

y(x) = 1

α cosh(αx).

(2.35)

(b) The constant α can be determined from the locations of the endpoints and the
length of the chain. As stated in the problem, the position of the chain may be
described by giving (1) the horizontal distance d between the two endpoints,
(2) the vertical distance λ between the two endpoints, and (3) the length (cid:2) of
the chain, as shown in Fig. 2.48. Note that it isn’t obvious what the horizontal
distances between the ends and the minimum point (which we have chosen as
the x = 0 point) are. If λ = 0, then these distances are d/2, by symmetry. But
otherwise, they aren’t so clear.

If we let the left endpoint be located at x = −x0, then the first of the above
three facts says that the right endpoint is located at x = d − x0. We now have
two unknowns, x0 and α. The second fact tells us that (we’ll take the right end

− cosh(−αx0) = αλ,
− sinh(−αx0) = α(cid:2).

We can eliminate x0 by taking the difference of the squares of these two
equations. Using the hyperbolic identities cosh2 u − sinh2 u = 1 and
cosh u cosh v − sinh u sinh v = cosh(u − v), we obtain
2 cosh(αd) − 2 = α2((cid:2)2 − λ2).
(2.39)
This is the desired equation that determines α. Given d, λ, and (cid:2), we can numer-
ically solve for α. Using a “half-angle” formula, you can show that Eq. (2.39)
may also be written as

(cid:4)

2 sinh(αd/2) = α

(cid:2)2 − λ2.

Statics

Remark: Let’s check a couple limits. If λ = 0 and (cid:2) = d (that is, the chain
forms a horizontal straight line), then Eq. (2.40) becomes 2 sinh(αd/2) = αd.
The solution to this is α = 0, which does indeed correspond to a horizontal
straight line, because for small α, we can use cosh (cid:9) ≈ 1 + (cid:9)2/2 to say that the
y(x) in Eq. (2.35) behaves like αx2/2 (up to an additive constant), which varies
slowly with x for small α. Another limit is where (cid:2) is much larger than both d
and λ. In this case, Eq. (2.40) becomes 2 sinh(αd/2) ≈ α(cid:2). The solution to this
is a large α (or more precisely, α (cid:6) 1/d), which corresponds to a “droopy”
chain, because the y(x) in Eq. (2.35) varies rapidly with x for large α. ♣

2.9. Hanging gently

We must first find the mass of the chain by calculating its length. Then we must
determine the slope of the chain at the supports, so we can find the components of
the force there. Using the given information, y(x) = (1/α) cosh(αx), the slope of the
chain as a function of x is

The weight of the rope is W = ρ(cid:2)g, where ρ is the mass per unit length. Each support
applies a vertical force of W /2. So this equals F sin θ , where F is the magnitude
of the force at each support, and θ is the angle it makes with the horizontal. Since
tan θ = y(cid:16)(d) = sinh(αd), we see from Fig. 2.49 that sin θ = tanh(αd). Therefore,

Taking the derivative of this (as a function of α), and setting the result equal to zero to
find the minimum, gives tanh(αd) = 1/(αd). This must be solved numerically. The
result is

αd ≈ 1.1997 ≡ η.

So α is given by α = η/d, and the shape of the chain that requires the minimum F is
thus

y(x) ≈ d

From Eqs. (2.42) and (2.44), the length of the chain is (cid:2) = (2d/η) sinh(η) ≈ (2.52)d.
To further get an idea of what the chain looks like, we can calculate the ratio of the
height, h, to the width, 2d.

(2.46)

We can also calculate the angle of the rope at the supports, using tan θ = sinh(αd).
This gives tan θ = sinh η, and so θ ≈ 56.5◦.

Remark: We can also ask what shape the chain should take in order to minimize
the horizontal or vertical component of F. The vertical component, Fy, is simply half
the weight, so we want the shortest possible chain, namely a horizontal one (which
requires an infinite F). This corresponds to α = 0. The horizontal component, Fx,
equals F cos θ. From Fig. 2.49, we see that cos θ = 1/ cosh(αd). Therefore, Eq. (2.43)
gives Fx = ρg/α. This goes to zero as α → ∞, which corresponds to a chain with
infinite length, that is, a very “droopy” chain. ♣

2.10. Mountain climber

Cheap lasso: We will take advantage of the fact that a cone is “flat,” in the sense
that we can make one out of a piece of paper, without crumpling the paper. Cut the
cone along a straight line emanating from the peak and passing through the knot of the
lasso, and roll the cone flat onto a plane. Call the resulting figure, which is a sector of
a circle, S (see Fig. 2.50). If the cone is very sharp, then S looks like a thin “pie piece.”
If the cone is very wide, with a shallow slope, then S looks like a pie with a piece taken
out of it. Points on the straight-line boundaries of the sector S are identified with each
other. Let P be the location of the lasso’s knot. Then P appears on each straight-line
boundary, at equal distances from the tip of S. Let β be the angle of the sector S.

The key to this problem is to realize that the path of the lasso’s loop must be a
straight line on S, as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 2.50. This is true because the rope
takes the shortest distance between two points because there is no friction, and rolling
the cone onto a plane doesn’t change distances. But a straight line between the two
identified points P is possible if and only if the sector S is smaller than a semicircle.
The condition for a climbable mountain is therefore β < 180◦.

What is this condition, in terms of the angle of the peak, α? Let C denote a cross-
sectional circle of the mountain, a distance d (measured along the cone) from the top.
(We are considering this circle for geometrical convenience. It is not the path of the
lasso; see the remark below.) A semicircular S implies that the circumference of C
equals πd. This then implies that the radius of C equals d/2. Therefore,

β

This is the condition under which the mountain is climbable. In short, having α < 60◦
guarantees that there is a loop around the cone with shorter length than the distance
straight to the peak and back.

=⇒ α < 60

(2.47)

◦

.

Remark: When viewed from the side, the rope will appear perpendicular to the side
of the mountain at the point opposite the lasso’s knot. A common mistake is to assume
that this implies that the climbable condition is α < 90◦. This is not the case, because
the loop does not lie in a plane. Lying in a plane, after all, would imply an elliptical
loop. But the loop must certainly have a kink in it where the knot is, because there
must exist a vertical component to the tension there to hold the climber up. If we had
posed the problem with a planar, triangular mountain, then the condition would have
been α < 90◦. ♣

Deluxe lasso:
If the mountain is very steep, the climber can slide down the mountain
by means of the loop growing larger. If the mountain has a shallow slope, the climber
can slide down by means of the loop growing smaller. The only situation in which the
climber doesn’t slide down is the one where the change in position of the knot along
the mountain is exactly compensated by the change in length of the loop.

Roll the cone onto a plane as we did in the cheap-lasso case. In terms of the sector S in
a plane, the above condition requires that if we move P a distance (cid:2) up (or down) along
the mountain, the distance between the identified points P must decrease (or increase)
by (cid:2). In Fig. 2.50, we must therefore have an equilateral triangle, so β = 60◦.

What peak-angle α does this correspond to? As in part the cheap-lasso case, let C be
a cross-sectional circle of the mountain, a distance d (measured along the cone) from
the top. Then β = 60◦ implies that the circumference of C equals (π/3)d. This then
implies that the radius of C equals d/6. Therefore,

sin(α/2) = d/6
d

=⇒ α ≈ 19

This is the condition under which the mountain is climbable. We see that there is
exactly one angle for which the climber can climb up along the mountain. The cheap

lasso is therefore much more useful than the fancy deluxe lasso, assuming, of course,
that you want to use it for climbing mountains, and not, say, for rounding up cattle.

Remark: Another way to see the β = 60◦ result is to note that the three directions
of rope emanating from the knot must all have the same tension, because the deluxe
lasso is one continuous piece of rope. They must therefore have 120◦ angles between
themselves (to provide zero net force on the massless knot). This implies that β = 60◦
in Fig. 2.50. ♣

Further remarks: For each type of lasso, we can also ask the question: For what
angles can the mountain be climbed if the lasso is looped N times around the top of
the mountain? The solution here is similar to that above.

For the cheap lasso, roll the cone N times onto a plane, as shown in Fig. 2.51 for
N = 4. The resulting figure, SN , is a sector of a circle divided into N equal sectors,
each representing a copy of the cone. As above, SN must be smaller than a semicircle.
The circumference of the circle C (defined above) must therefore be less than πd/N .
Hence, the radius of C must be less than d/2N . Thus,

For the deluxe lasso, again roll the cone N times onto a plane. From the original

πd/3N , and so its radius must be d/6N . Therefore,

2.11. Equality of torques

The proof by induction is as follows. Assume that we have shown that a force F
applied at a distance d is equivalent to a force kF applied at a distance d/k, for all
integers k up to n − 1. We now want to show that the statement holds for k = n.

Consider the situation in Fig. 2.52. Forces F are applied at the ends of a stick, and
forces 2F/(n − 1) are applied at the j(cid:2)/n marks (for 1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1). The stick doesn’t
rotate (by symmetry), and it doesn’t translate (because the net force is zero). Consider
the stick to have a pivot at the left end. Replacing the interior forces by their equivalent
ones at the (cid:2)/n mark (see Fig. 2.52) gives a total force there equal to

(cid:7)

2F
n − 1

(cid:8)

= 2F
n − 1

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

n(n − 1)
2

= nF.

(2.51)

We therefore see that a force F applied at a distance (cid:2) is equivalent to a force nF
applied at a distance (cid:2)/n, as was to be shown.

We can now show that Claim 2.1 holds, for arbitrary distances a and b (see Fig. 2.53).
Consider the stick to be pivoted at its left end, and let (cid:9) be a tiny distance (small
compared with a). Then a force F3 at a distance a is equivalent to a force F3(a/(cid:9)) at
a distance (cid:9).10 But a force F3(a/(cid:9)) at a distance (cid:9) is equivalent to a force F3(a/(cid:9))
((cid:9)/(a + b)) = F3a/(a + b) at a distance (a + b). This equivalent force at the distance
(a + b) must cancel the force F2 there, because the stick is motionless. Therefore, we
have F3a/(a + b) = F2, which proves the claim.

2.12. Direction of the tension

Consider an infinitesimal piece of the rope, and look at the torque around one end.
Any forces acting at this end provide no torque around it. If the tension at the other

10 Technically, we can use the reasoning in the previous paragraph to say this only if a/(cid:9) is an integer,
but since a/(cid:9) is very large, we can simply pick the closest integer to it, and there will be negligible
error.

2.5 Solutions

47

end is directed at a finite angle away from the direction of the rope, then this produces
a certain torque. But this torque can’t be canceled by the much smaller torque from
the tiny gravitational force, because this force is proportional to the length of the tiny
piece. Therefore, the tension must point along the rope. It actually points along the
direction of the rope at the end of the little piece it acts on, which isn’t quite along the
direction of the rope at the end we’re considering torques around, because the rope
bends (assuming it’s not vertical). So the tension ends up producing a very small torque
which cancels the very small torque from gravity.

This argument doesn’t work for a rigid stick, because the stick can produce finite
torques around the end of a piece via forces at that end, because the end is really
a cross section of finite size. There is a shearing action in the stick, and the large
shearing forces act with tiny lever arms (relative to, say, a point at the middle of the
cross section) to produce finite torques.

2.13. Find the force

In Fig. 2.54, let the supports at the ends exert forces F1 and F2, and let the support in
the interior exert a force F. Then

F1 + F2 + F = Mg.

(2.53)

where we have used the fact that the stick can be treated like a point mass at its center.
Note that the equation for balancing the torques around the center of mass is redundant;
it is obtained by taking the difference of the two previous equations and then dividing
by 2. And balancing torques around the middle pivot also takes the form of a linear
combination of these equations, as you can show.

It appears as though we have three equations and three unknowns, but we really have
only two equations, because the sum of Eqs. (2.53) gives Eq. (2.52). Therefore, since
we have two equations and three unknowns, the system is underdetermined. Solving
Eqs. (2.53) for F1 and F2 in terms of F, we see that any forces of the form

are possible. In retrospect, it makes sense that the forces are not determined. By
changing the height of the new support an infinitesimal distance, we can make F be
anything from 0 up to Mg(a + b)/2b, which is when the stick comes off the left support
(assuming b ≥ a).

2.14. Leaning sticks

Let Ml be the mass of the left stick, and let Mr be the mass of the right stick. Then
Ml/Mr = tan θ. Let N and Ff be the normal and friction forces between the sticks
(see Fig. 2.55). Ff has a maximum value of µN . Balancing the torques on the left
stick (around the contact point with the ground) gives N = (Mlg/2) sin θ . Balancing
the torques on the right stick (around the contact point with the ground) gives Ff =
(Mrg/2) cos θ. The condition Ff ≤ µN is therefore

where we have used Ml/Mr = tan θ. This answer checks in the two extremes: In the
limit µ → 0, we see that θ must be very close to π/2, which makes sense. And in the
limit µ → ∞ (that is, very sticky sticks), we see that θ can be very small, which also
makes sense.

48

Statics

2.15. Supporting a ladder

Let F be the desired force. F must be directed along the stick, because otherwise
there would be a net torque on the (massless) stick relative to the pivot at its right
end, and this would contradict the fact that it is at rest. Look at torques on the ladder
around the pivot at its bottom. The gravitational force provides a clockwise torque of
Mg(L/2) cos θ, and the force F from the stick provides a counterclockwise torque of
F((cid:2)/ tan θ). Equating these two torques gives

F = MgL

2(cid:2) sin θ .

(2.56)

Remarks: F goes to zero as θ → 0, as it should.11 And F increases to MgL/2(cid:2)
as θ → π/2, which isn’t so obvious (the required torque from the stick is very
small, but the lever arm is also very small). However, in the special case where
the ladder is exactly vertical, no force is required. You can see that our calcula-
tions above are not valid in this case, because we divided by cos θ , which is zero
when θ = π/2.

The normal force at the pivot of the stick (which equals the vertical component of
F, because the stick is massless) is equal to MgL sin θ cos θ/2(cid:2). This has a maximum
value of MgL/4(cid:2) at θ = π/4. ♣

2.16. Balancing the stick

Let the stick go off to infinity in the positive x direction, and let it be cut at x = x0.
Then the pivot point is located at x = x0 + (cid:2) (see Fig. 2.56). Let the density be ρ(x).
The condition that the total gravitational torque relative to x0 + (cid:2) be zero is

We want this to equal zero for all x0, so the derivative of τ with respect to x0 must be
zero. τ depends on x0 through both the limits of integration and the integrand. In taking
the derivative, the former dependence requires finding the value of the integrand at
the x0 limit, while the latter dependence requires taking the derivative of the integrand
with respect to x0, and then integrating. (To derive these two contributions, just replace
x0 with x0 + dx0 and expand things to first order in dx0.) We obtain

0 = dτ

Taking the derivative of this equation with respect to x0 gives (cid:2)ρ(cid:16)(x0) = −ρ(x0). The
solution to this is (rewriting the arbitrary x0 as x)

ρ(x) = Ae

−x/(cid:2)

.

(2.59)

We therefore see that the density decreases exponentially with x. The smaller (cid:2) is, the
quicker it falls off. Note that the density at the pivot is 1/e times the density at the left
end. And you can show that 1 − 1/e ≈ 63 % of the mass is contained between the left
end and the pivot.

2.17. The spool

(a) Let Ff be the friction force the ground provides. Balancing the horizontal forces

on the spool gives (see Fig. 2.57)

T cos θ = Ff .

(2.60)

11 For θ → 0, we would need to lengthen the ladder with a massless extension, because the stick

would have to be very far to the right to remain perpendicular to the ladder.

The niceness of this result suggests that there is a quicker way to obtain it. And
indeed, we see from Fig. 2.58 that cos θ = r/R is the angle that causes the line
of the tension to pass through the contact point on the ground. Since gravity
and friction provide no torque around this point, the total torque around it is
therefore zero, and the spool remains at rest.

(b) The normal force from the ground is

N = Mg − T sin θ .

(2.63)

Using Eq. (2.60), the statement Ff ≤ µN becomes

T cos θ ≤ µ(Mg − T sin θ) =⇒ T ≤

µMg
cos θ + µ sin θ ,

(2.64)

Fig. 2.58

where θ is given in Eq. (2.62).

(c) The maximum value of T is given in (2.64). This depends on θ , which in turn
depends on r. We want to find the r that minimizes this maximum T . Taking the
derivative with respect to θ, we find that the θ that maximizes the denominator
in Eq. (2.64) is given by tan θ0 = µ. You can then show that the value of T for
this θ0 is

T0 =

µMg(cid:4)

To find the corresponding r, we can use Eq. (2.62) to write tan θ =

T0 = Mg, and r0 = 0.

2.18. Stick on a circle

Let N be the normal force between the stick and the circle, and let Ff be the friction
force between the ground and the circle (see Fig. 2.59). Then we immediately see that
the friction force between the stick and the circle is also Ff , because the torques from
the two friction forces on the circle must cancel. We’ve drawn all forces as acting
on the circle. By Newton’s third law, N and Ff act in the opposite directions on the
stick at its top end.

Looking at torques on the stick around the point of contact with the ground, we

Therefore, N = (ρ(cid:2)g/2) cos θ. Balancing the horizontal forces on the circle gives

isn’t so obvious.

2.19. Leaning sticks and circles

Let Si be the ith stick, and let Ci be the ith circle. The normal forces that Ci feels
from Si and Si+1 are equal in magnitude, because these two forces provide the only
horizontal forces on the frictionless circle, so they must cancel. Let Ni be this normal
force.

Look at the torques on Si+1, relative to the hinge on the ground. The torques come
from Ni, Ni+1, and the weight of Si+1. From Fig. 2.60, we see that Ni acts at a point
which is a distance R tan(θ/2) away from the hinge. Since the stick has a length
R/ tan(θ/2), this point is a fraction tan2(θ/2) up along the stick. Therefore, balancing
the torques on Si+1 gives

Remarks: N∞ goes to infinity for θ → 0, which makes sense, because the sticks are
very long. All of the Ni are essentially equal to half the weight of a stick (in order to
cancel the torque from the weight relative to the pivot). For θ → π/2, we see from
Eq. (2.73) that N∞ approaches ρRg/4, which is not at all obvious; the Ni start off at
N1 = (Mg/2) cos θ ≈ 0, but gradually increase to ρRg/4, which is a quarter of the
weight of a stick. Note that the horizontal force that must be applied to the last circle
far to the right is N∞ sin θ = ρRg cos4(θ/2). This ranges from ρRg for θ → 0, to
ρRg/4 for θ → π/2. ♣

Chapter 3
Using F = ma

The general goal of classical mechanics is to determine what happens to a given
set of objects in a given physical situation. In order to figure this out, we need to
know what makes the objects move the way they do. There are two main ways
of going about this task. The first one, which you are undoubtedly familiar with,
involves Newton’s laws. This is the subject of the present chapter. The second
one, which is more advanced, is the Lagrangian method. This is the subject of
Chapter 6. It should be noted that each of these methods is perfectly sufficient
for solving any problem, and they both produce the same information in the end.
But they are based on vastly different principles. We’ll talk more about this in
Chapter 6.

3.1 Newton’s laws

In 1687 Newton published his three laws in his Principia Mathematica. These
laws are fairly intuitive, although I suppose it’s questionable to attach the adjective
“intuitive” to a set of statements that weren’t written down until a mere 300 years
ago. At any rate, the laws may be stated as follows.

• First law: A body moves with constant velocity (which may be zero) unless acted on

by a force.

• Second law: The time rate of change of the momentum of a body equals the force acting

on the body.

• Third law: For every force on one body, there is an equal and opposite force on another

body.

We could discuss for days on end the degree to which these statements are
physical laws, and the degree to which they are definitions. Sir Arthur Eddington
once made the unflattering remark that the first law essentially says that “every
particle continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line except
insofar as it doesn’t.” However, although the three laws might seem somewhat
light on content at first glance, there’s actually more to them than Eddington’s
comment implies. Let’s look at each in turn.1

1 A disclaimer: This section represents my view on which parts of the laws are definitions and which
parts have content. But you should take all of this with a grain of salt. For further reading, see
Anderson (1990), Keller (1987), O’Sullivan (1980), and Eisenbud (1958).

Using F =ma

First law
One thing this law does is give a definition of zero force. Another thing it does
is give a definition of an inertial frame, which is defined simply as a frame of
reference in which the first law holds; since the term “velocity” is used, we have
to state what frame we’re measuring the velocity with respect to. The first law
does not hold in an arbitrary frame. For example, it fails in the frame of a rotating
turntable.2 Intuitively, an inertial frame is one that moves with constant velocity.
But this is ambiguous, because we have to say what the frame is moving with
constant velocity with respect to. But all this aside, an inertial frame is defined
as the special type of frame in which the first law holds.

So, what we now have are two intertwined definitions of “force” and “inertial
frame.” Not much physical content here. But the important point is that the law
holds for all particles. So if we have a frame in which one free particle moves
with constant velocity, then all free particles move with constant velocity. This
is a statement with content. We can’t have a bunch of free particles moving with
constant velocity while another one is doing a fancy jig.

Second law
Momentum is defined3 to be mv. If m is constant,4 then the second law says that

F = ma,

(3.1)

where a ≡ dv/dt. This law holds only in an inertial frame, which is defined by
the first law.

For things moving free or at rest,
Observe what the first law does best.
It defines a key frame,
“Inertial” by name,
Where the second law then is expressed.

You might think that the second law merely gives a definition of force, but
there is more to it than that. There is a tacit implication in the law that this “force”
is something that has an existence that isn’t completely dependent on the particle
whose “m” appears in the law (more on this in the third law below). A spring
force, for example, doesn’t depend at all on the particle on which it acts. And
the gravitational force, GMm/r2, depends partly on the particle and partly on
something else (another mass).

2 It’s possible to modify things so that Newton’s laws hold in such a frame, provided that we introduce

the so-called “fictitious” forces. But we’ll save this discussion for Chapter 10.

3 We’re doing everything nonrelativistically here, of course. Chapter 12 gives the relativistic

modification to the mv expression.

4 We’ll assume in this chapter that m is constant. But don’t worry, we’ll get plenty of practice with

changing mass (in rockets and such) in Chapter 5.

3.1 Newton’s laws

53

If you feel like just making up definitions, then you can define a new quantity,
G = m2a. This is a perfectly legal thing to do; you can’t really go wrong
in making a definition (well, unless you’ve already defined the quantity to be
something else). However, this definition is completely useless. You can define
it for every particle in the world, and for any acceleration, but the point is that
the definitions don’t have anything to do with each other. There is simply no
(uncontrived) quantity in this world that gives accelerations in the ratio of 4 to
1 when “acting” on masses m and 2m. The quantity G has nothing to do with
anything except the particle you defined it for. The main thing the second law
says is that there does indeed exist a quantity F that gives the same ma when
acting on different particles. The statement of the existence of such a thing is far
more than a definition.

Along this same line, note that the second law says that F = ma, and not,
for example, F = mv, or F = m d3x/dt3. In addition to being inconsistent with
the real world, these expressions are inconsistent with the first law. F = mv
would say that a nonzero velocity requires a force, in contrast with the first law.
And F = md3x/dt3 would say that a particle moves with constant acceleration
(instead of constant velocity) unless acted on by a force, also in contrast with the
first law.

As with the first law, it is important to realize that the second law holds for
all particles. In other words, if the same force (for example, the same spring
stretched by the same amount) acts on two particles with masses m1 and m2, then
Eq. (3.1) says that their accelerations are related by

a1
a2

= m2
m1

.

(3.2)

This relation holds regardless of what the common force is. Therefore, once
we’ve used one force to find the relative masses of two objects, then we know
what the ratio of their a’s will be when they are subjected to any other force. Of
course, we haven’t really defined mass yet. But Eq. (3.2) gives an experimental
method for determining an object’s mass in terms of a standard (say, 1 kg) mass.
All we have to do is compare its acceleration with that of the standard mass, when
acted on by the same force.

Note that F = ma is a vector equation, so it is really three equations in one.

In Cartesian coordinates, it says that Fx = max, Fy = may, and Fz = maz.

Third law
One thing this law says is that if we have two isolated particles interacting through
some force, then their accelerations are opposite in direction and inversely pro-
portional to their masses. Equivalently, the third law essentially postulates that

54

Using F =ma

the total momentum of an isolated system is conserved (that is, independent of
time). To see this, consider two particles, each of which interacts only with the
other particle and nothing else in the universe. Then we have

dptotal
dt

+ dp2
dt

= dp1
dt
= F1 + F2,

(3.3)

where F1 and F2 are the forces acting on m1 and m2, respectively. This demon-
strates that momentum conservation (that is, dptotal/dt = 0) is equivalent to
Newton’s third law (that is, F1 = −F2). Similar reasoning holds with more
than two particles, but we’ll save this more general case, along with many other
aspects of momentum, for Chapter 5.

There isn’t much left to be defined via this law, so this is a law of pure content.
It can’t be a definition, anyway, because it’s actually not always valid. It holds
for forces of the “pushing” and “pulling” type, but it fails for the magnetic force,
for example. In that case, momentum is carried off in the electromagnetic field
(so the total momentum of the particles and the field is conserved). But we won’t
deal with fields here. Just particles. So the third law will always hold in any
situation we’ll be concerned with.

The third law contains an extremely important piece of information. It says
that we will never find a particle accelerating unless there’s some other parti-
cle accelerating somewhere else. The other particle might be far away, as with
the earth–sun system, but it’s always out there somewhere. Note that if we were
given only the second law, then it would be perfectly possible for a given particle
to spontaneously accelerate with nothing else happening in the universe, as long
as a similar particle with twice the mass accelerated with half the acceleration
when placed in the same spot, etc. This would all be fine, as far as the second law
goes. We would say that a force with a certain value is acting at the point, and
everything would be consistent. But the third law says that this is simply not the
way the world (at least the one we live in) works. In a sense, a force without a
counterpart seems somewhat like magic, whereas a force with an equal and oppo-
site counterpart has a “cause and effect” nature, which seems (and apparently is)
more physical.

In the end, however, we shouldn’t attach too much significance to Newton’s
laws, because although they were a remarkable intellectual achievement and
work spectacularly for everyday physics, they are the laws of a theory that is only
approximate. Newtonian physics is a limiting case of the more correct theories
of relativity and quantum mechanics, which are in turn limiting cases of yet more
correct theories. The way in which particles (or waves, or strings, or whatever)
interact on the most fundamental level surely doesn’t bear any resemblance to
what we call forces.

3.2 Free-body diagrams

3.2 Free-body diagrams

The law that allows us to be quantitative is the second law. Given a force, we can
apply F = ma to find the acceleration. And knowing the acceleration, we can
determine the behavior of a given object (that is, the position and velocity), pro-
vided that we are given the initial position and velocity. This process sometimes
takes a bit of work, but there are two basic types of situations that commonly
arise.

• In many problems, all you are given is a physical situation (for example, a block
resting on a plane, strings connecting masses, etc.), and it is up to you to find all the
forces acting on all the objects, using F = ma. The forces generally point in various
directions, so it’s easy to lose track of them. It therefore proves useful to isolate the
objects and draw all the forces acting on each of them. This is the subject of the present
section.

• In other problems, you are given the force explicitly as a function of time, position,
or velocity, and the task immediately becomes the mathematical one of solving the
F = ma ≡ m¨x equation (we’ll just deal with one dimension here). These differential
equations can be difficult (or impossible) to solve exactly. They are the subject of
Section 3.3.

Let’s consider here the first of these two types of scenarios, where we are pre-
sented with a physical situation and we must determine all the forces involved.
The term free-body diagram is used to denote a diagram with all the forces
drawn on a given object. After drawing such a diagram for each object in the
setup, we simply write down all the F = ma equations they imply. The result
will be a system of linear equations in various unknown forces and accelera-
tions, for which we can then solve. This procedure is best understood through an
example.

Example (A plane and masses): Mass M1 is held on a plane with inclination
angle θ, and mass M2 hangs over the side. The two masses are connected by a
massless string which runs over a massless pulley (see Fig. 3.1). The coefficient of
kinetic friction between M1 and the plane is µ. M1 is released from rest. Assuming that
M2 is sufficiently large so that M1 gets pulled up the plane, what is the acceleration
of the masses? What is the tension in the string?

θ

Fig. 3.1

M1
µ

M2

Solution: The first thing to do is draw all the forces on the two masses. These are
shown in Fig. 3.2. The forces on M2 are gravity and the tension. The forces on M1 are
gravity, friction, the tension, and the normal force. Note that the friction force points
down the plane, because we are assuming that M1 moves up the plane.

Having drawn all the forces, we can now write down all the F = ma equations.
When dealing with M1, we could break things up into horizontal and vertical compo-
nents, but it is much cleaner to use the components parallel and perpendicular to the

plane.5 These two components of F = ma, along with the vertical F = ma equation
for M2, give

T − f − M1g sin θ = M1a,
N − M1g cos θ = 0,

M2g − T = M2a,

(3.4)

where we have used the fact that the two masses accelerate at the same rate (and
we have defined the positive direction for M2 to be downward). We have also used
the fact that the tension is the same at both ends of the string, because otherwise there
would be a net force on some part of the string which would then undergo infinite
acceleration, because it is massless.

There are four unknowns in Eq. (3.4) (namely T , a, N , and f ), but only three
equations. Fortunately, we have a fourth equation: f = µN , because we are assuming
that M1 is in fact moving, so we can use the expression for kinetic friction. Using this
in the second equation above gives f = µM1g cos θ. The first equation then becomes
T − µM1g cos θ − M1g sin θ = M1a. Adding this to the third equation leaves us with
only a, so we find
a = g(M2 − µM1 cos θ − M1 sin θ)
M1 + M2

=⇒ T = M1M2g(1 + µ cos θ + sin θ)
(3.5)

M1 + M2

.

Note that in order for M1 to in fact accelerate upward (that is, a > 0), we must have
M2 > M1(µ cos θ + sin θ). This is clear from looking at the forces along the plane.

Remark:
plane, then the friction force points up the plane, and we find (as you can check),

If we instead assume that M1 is sufficiently large so that it slides down the

a = g(M2 + µM1 cos θ − M1 sin θ )

M1 + M2

,

and T = M1M2g(1 − µ cos θ + sin θ )

M1 + M2

.

(3.6)

In order for M1 to in fact accelerate downward (that is, a < 0), we must have M2 <
M1(sin θ − µ cos θ). Therefore, the range of M2 for which the system doesn’t accelerate
(that is, it just sits there, assuming that it started at rest) is

M1(sin θ − µ cos θ ) ≤ M2 ≤ M1(sin θ + µ cos θ ).

(3.7)

If µ is very small, then M2 must essentially be equal to M1 sin θ if the system is to
be static. Equation (3.7) also implies that if tan θ ≤ µ, then M1 won’t slide down,
even if M2 = 0. ♣

In problems like the one above, it’s clear which things you should pick as the
objects you’re going to draw forces on. But in other problems, where there are

5 When dealing with inclined planes, it’s usually the case that one of these two coordinate systems
works much better than the other. Sometimes it isn’t clear which one, but if things get messy with
one system, you can always try the other.

3.2 Free-body diagrams

various different subsystems you can choose, you must be careful to include all
the relevant forces on a given subsystem. Which subsystems you want to pick
depends on what quantities you’re trying to find. Consider the following example.

Example (Platform and pulley): A person stands on a platform-and-pulley sys-
tem, as shown in Fig. 3.3. The masses of the platform, person, and pulley6 are M , m,
and µ, respectively.7 The rope is massless. Let the person pull up on the rope so that
she has acceleration a upward. (Assume that the platform is somehow constrained to
stay level, perhaps by having the ends run along some rails.) Find the tension in the
rope, the normal force between the person and the platform, and the tension in the
rod connecting the pulley to the platform.

a

µ

m

Solution: To find the tension in the rope, we simply want to let our subsystem be
the whole system (except the ceiling). If we imagine putting the system in a black
box (to emphasize the fact that we don’t care about any internal forces within the
system), then the forces we see “protruding” from the box are the three weights (Mg,
mg, and µg) downward, and the tension T upward. Applying F = ma to the whole
system gives

M

Fig. 3.3

T − (M + m + µ)g = (M + m + µ)a =⇒ T = (M + m + µ)(g + a).

(3.8)

To find the normal force N between the person and the platform, and also the tension
f in the rod connecting the pulley to the platform, it is not sufficient to consider the
system as a whole. This is true because these forces are internal forces to this system,
so they won’t show up in any F = ma equations (which involve only external forces
to a system). So we must consider subsystems:

• Let’s apply F = ma to the person. The forces acting on the person are gravity, the
normal force from the platform, and the tension from the rope (pulling downward
on her hand). So we have

N − T − mg = ma.

(3.9)

• Now apply F = ma to the platform. The forces acting on the platform are gravity,
the normal force from the person, and the force upward from the rod. So we have

f − N − Mg = Ma.

(3.10)

• Now apply F = ma to the pulley. The forces acting on the pulley are gravity, the
force downward from the rod, and twice the tension in the rope (because it pulls

6 Assume that the pulley’s mass is concentrated at its center, so that we don’t have to worry about

any rotational dynamics (the subject of Chapter 8).

7 My apologies for using µ as a mass here, since it usually denotes a coefficient of friction. Alas,

there are only so many symbols for “m.”

58

Using F =ma

up on both sides). So we have

2T − f − µg = µa.

(3.11)

Note that if we add up the three previous equations, we obtain the F = ma equation
in Eq. (3.8), as should be the case, because the whole system is the sum of the three
above subsystems. Equations (3.9)–(3.11) are three equations in the three unknowns,
T , N , and f . Their sum yields the T in (3.8), and then Eqs. (3.9) and (3.11) give,
respectively, as you can show,

N = (M + 2m + µ)(g + a),

and

f = (2M + 2m + µ)(g + a).

(3.12)

Remarks: You can also obtain these results by considering subsystems different from the
ones we chose above. For example, you can choose the pulley-plus-platform subsystem,
etc. But no matter how you choose to break up the system, you will need to produce three
independent F = ma equations in order to solve for the three unknowns, T , N , and f .

In problems like this one, it’s easy to forget to include certain forces, such as the second T
in Eq. (3.11). The safest thing to do is to always isolate each subsystem, draw a box around
it, and then draw all the forces that “protrude” from the box. In other words, draw the
free-body diagram. Figure 3.4 shows the free-body diagram for the subsystem consisting
of only the pulley. ♣

Another class of problems, similar to the above example, goes by the name
of Atwood’s machines. An Atwood’s machine is the name used for any system
consisting of a combination of masses, strings, and pulleys.8 In general, the
pulleys and strings can have mass, but we’ll deal only with massless ones in
this chapter. As we’ll see in the following example, there are two basic steps in
solving an Atwood’s problem: (1) write down all the F = ma equations, and
(2) relate the accelerations of the various masses by noting that the length of the
string(s) doesn’t change, a fact that we call “conservation of string.”

Example (Atwood’s machine): Consider the pulley system in Fig. 3.5, with
masses m1 and m2. The strings and pulleys are massless. What are the accelerations
of the masses? What is the tension in the string?

Solution: The first thing to note is that the tension T is the same everywhere
throughout the massless string, because otherwise there would be an infinite accel-
eration of some part of the string. It then follows that the tension in the short string
connected to m2 is 2T . This is true because there must be zero net force on the mass-
less right pulley, because otherwise it would have infinite acceleration. The F = ma

8 George Atwood (1746–1807) was a tutor at Cambridge University. He published the description
of the first of his machines in Atwood (1784). For a history of Atwood’s machines, see Greenslade
(1985).

3.2 Free-body diagrams

59

equations for the two masses are therefore (with upward taken to be positive)

T − m1g = m1a1,
2T − m2g = m2a2.

(3.13)

We now have two equations in the three unknowns, a1, a2, and T . So we need one
more equation. This is the “conservation of string” fact, which relates a1 and a2.
If we imagine moving m2 and the right pulley up a distance d, then a length 2d
of string has disappeared from the two parts of the string touching the right pulley.
This string has to go somewhere, so it ends up in the part of the string touching m1
(see Fig. 3.6). Therefore, m1 goes down by a distance 2d. In other words, y1 =
−2y2, where y1 and y2 are measured relative to the initial locations of the masses.
Taking two time derivatives of this statement gives our desired relation between
a1 and a2,

a1 = −2a2.

(3.14)

Combining this with Eq. (3.13), we can now solve for a1, a2, and T . The result is

(3.15)

Fig. 3.6

Remarks: There are all sorts of limits and special cases that we can check here. A couple
are: (1) If m2 = 2m1, then Eq. (3.15) gives a1 = a2 = 0, and T = m1g. Everything is
at rest. (2) If m2 (cid:6) m1, then Eq. (3.15) gives a1 = 2g, a2 = −g, and T = 3m1g. In
this case, m2 is essentially in free fall, while m1 gets yanked up with acceleration 2g. The
value of T is exactly what is needed to make the net force on m1 equal to m1(2g), because
T − m1g = 3m1g − m1g = m1(2g). You can check the case where m1 (cid:6) m2.

For the more general case where there are N masses instead of two, the “conservation
of string” statement is a single equation that relates all N accelerations. It is most easily
obtained by imagining moving N − 1 of the masses, each by an arbitrary amount, and then
seeing what happens to the last mass. Note that these arbitrary motions undoubtedly do
not correspond to the actual motions of the masses. This is fine; the single “conservation
of string” equation has nothing to do with the N F = ma equations. The combination of
all N + 1 equations is needed to constrain the motions down to a unique set. ♣

In the problems and exercises for this chapter, you will encounter some strange
Atwood’s setups. But no matter how complicated they get, there are only two
things you need to do to solve them, as mentioned above: write down the F = ma
equations for all the masses (which may involve relating the tensions in various
strings), and then relate the accelerations of the masses, using “conservation of
string.”

It may seem, with the angst it can bring,
That an Atwood’s machine’s a cruel thing.
But you just need to say
That F is ma,
And use conservation of string!

60

Using F =ma

3.3 Solving differential equations

Let’s now consider the type of problem where we are given the force as a function
of time, position, or velocity, and our task is to solve the F = ma ≡ m¨x differ-
ential equation to find the position, x(t), as a function of time.9 In what follows,
we will develop a few techniques for solving differential equations. The ability
to apply these techniques dramatically increases the number of systems we can
understand.

It’s also possible for the force F to be a function of higher derivatives of x,
in addition to the quantities t, x, and v ≡ ˙x. But these cases don’t arise much, so
we won’t worry about them. The F = ma differential equation we want to solve
is therefore (we’ll just work in one dimension here)

m¨x = F(t, x, v).

(3.16)

In general, this equation cannot be solved exactly for x(t).10 But for most of
the problems we’ll deal with, it can be solved. The problems we’ll encounter
will often fall into one of three special cases, namely, where F is a function of t
only, or x only, or v only. In all of these cases, we must invoke the given initial
conditions, x0 ≡ x(t0) and v0 ≡ v(t0), to obtain our final solutions. These initial
conditions will appear in the limits of the integrals in the following discussion.11
Note: You may want to just skim the following page and a half, and then refer
back as needed. Don’t try to memorize all the different steps. We present them
only for completeness. The whole point here can basically be summarized by
saying that sometimes you want to write ¨x as dv/dt, and sometimes you want to
write it as v dv/dx (see Eq. (3.20)). Then you “simply” have to separate variables
and integrate. We’ll go through the three special cases, and then we’ll do some
examples.

• F is a function of t only: F = F(t).

Since a = d2x/dt2, we just need to integrate F = ma twice to obtain x(t). Let’s do this
in a very systematic way, to get used to the general procedure. First, write F = ma as

m

dv
dt

= F(t).

(3.17)

9 In some setups, such as in Problem 3.11, the force isn’t given, so you have to figure out what it is.

But the main part of the problem is still solving the resulting differential equation.

10 You can always solve for x(t) numerically, to any desired accuracy. This topic is discussed in

Section 1.4.

11 It is no coincidence that we need two initial conditions to completely specify the solution to
our second-order (meaning the highest derivative of x that appears is the second one) F = m¨x
differential equation. It is a general result (which we’ll just accept here) that the solution to an
nth-order differential equation has n free parameters, which are determined by the initial conditions.

This yields x as a function of t, that is, x(t). This procedure might seem like a cumber-
some way to simply integrate something twice. That’s because it is. But the technique
proves more useful in the following case.

is v(cid:16)2/2, so the left-hand side involves the square of v(x). Taking
The integral of v(cid:16)
the square root, this gives v as a function of x, that is, v(x). Separating variables in
dx/dt ≡ v(x) then yields

(3.23)

Assuming that we can do the integral on the left-hand side, this equation gives t as a
function of x. We can then (in principle) invert the result to obtain x as a function of t,
that is, x(t). The unfortunate thing about this case is that the integral in Eq. (3.23) might
not be doable. And even if it is, it might not be possible to invert t(x) to produce x(t).

12 If you haven’t seen such a thing before, the act of multiplying both sides by the infinitesimal
quantity dt might make you feel a bit uneasy. But it is in fact quite legal. If you wish, you can
imagine working with the small (but not infinitesimal) quantities (cid:16)v and (cid:16)t, for which it is
certainly legal to multiply both sides by (cid:16)t. Then you can take a discrete sum over many (cid:16)t
intervals, and then finally take the limit (cid:16)t → 0, which results in the integral in Eq. (3.18).

We can then obtain x(t) from Eq. (3.23), if desired.

When dealing with the initial conditions, we have chosen to put them in the
limits of integration above. If you wish, you can perform the integrals without
any limits, and just tack on a constant of integration to your result. The constant
is then determined by the initial conditions.

Again, as mentioned above, you do not have to memorize the above three
procedures, because there are variations, depending on what you’re given and
what you want to solve for. All you have to remember is that ¨x can be written
as either dv/dt or v dv/dx. One of these will get the job done (namely, the one
that makes only two of the three variables, t, x, and v, appear in your differential
equation). And then be prepared to separate variables and integrate as many times
as needed.13

a is dv by dt.
Is this useful? There’s no guarantee.
If it leads to “Oh, heck!” s,
Take dv by dx,
And then write down its product with v.

13 We want only two of the variables to appear in the differential equation because the goal is to
separate variables and integrate, and because equations have only two sides. If equations were
triangles, it would be a different story.

3.3 Solving differential equations

63

Example (Gravitational force): A particle of mass m is subject to a constant
force F = −mg. The particle starts at rest at height h. Because this constant force
falls into all of the above three categories, we should be able to solve for y(t) in two
ways:

(a) Find y(t) by writing a as dv/dt.
(b) Find y(t) by writing a as v dv/dy.

Solution:

(a) F = ma gives dv/dt = −g. Multiplying by dt and integrating yields v =
−gt + A, where A is a constant of integration.14 The initial condition v(0) = 0
gives A = 0. Therefore, dy/dt = −gt. Multiplying by dt and integrating yields
y = −gt2/2 + B. The initial condition y(0) = h gives B = h. Therefore,

y = h − 1
2

gt2.

(3.28)

(b) F = ma gives v dv/dy = −g. Separating variables and integrating yields
v2/2 = −gy + C. The initial condition v(h) = 0 gives v2/2 = −gy + gh.
Therefore, v ≡ dy/dt = −
2g(h − y). We have chosen the negative square
root because the particle is falling. Separating variables gives

This yields 2
h. Hence, y = h − gt2/2, as in part (a). In part (b) here, we essentially derived
conservation of energy, as we’ll see in Chapter 5.

Example (Dropped ball): A beach ball is dropped from rest at height h. Assume
that the drag force15 from the air takes the form of Fd = −βv. Find the velocity and
height as a function of time.
Solution: For simplicity in future formulas, let’s write the drag force as Fd =
−βv ≡ −mαv (otherwise we’d have a bunch of 1/m’s floating around). Taking
upward to be the positive y direction, the force on the ball is

F = −mg − mαv.

(3.30)

14 We’ll do this example by adding on constants of integration which are then determined by the
initial conditions. We’ll do the following example by putting the initial conditions in the limits of
integration.

15 The drag force is roughly proportional to v as long as the speed is fairly small (say, less than
10 m/s). For large speeds (say, greater than 100 m/s), the drag force is roughly proportional to
v2. But these approximate cutoffs depend on various things, and in any event there is a messy
transition region between the two cases.

64

Note that v is negative here, because the ball is falling, so the drag force points

Therefore,

Remarks:

1. Let’s look at some limiting cases. If t is very small (more precisely, if αt (cid:4) 1), then
we can use e−x ≈ 1 − x + x2/2 to make approximations to leading order in t. You
can show that Eq. (3.32) gives v(t) ≈ −gt. This makes sense, because the drag force
is negligible at the start, so the ball is essentially in freefall. And likewise you can
show that Eq. (3.34) gives y(t) ≈ h − gt2/2, which is again the freefall result.

We can also look at large t. In this case, e−αt is essentially equal to zero, so
Eq. (3.32) gives v(t) ≈ −g/α. (This is the “terminal velocity.” Its value makes
sense, because it is the velocity for which the total force, −mg − mαv, vanishes.)
And Eq. (3.34) gives y(t) ≈ h − (g/α)t + g/α2. Interestingly, we see that for large
t, g/α2 is the distance our ball lags behind another ball that started out already at the
terminal velocity, −g/α.

2. You might think that the velocity in Eq. (3.32) doesn’t depend on m, since no m’s
appear. However, there is an m hidden in α. The quantity α (which we introduced
just to make our formulas look a little nicer) was defined by Fd = −βv ≡ −mαv.
But the quantity β ≡ mα is roughly proportional to the cross-sectional area, A, of
the ball. Therefore, α ∝ A/m. Two balls of the same size, one made of lead and one
made of styrofoam, have the same A but different m’s. So their α’s are different, and
they fall at different rates.

If we have a solid ball with density ρ and radius r, then α ∝ A/m ∝ r2/(ρr3) =
1/ρr. For large dense objects in a thin medium such as air, the quantity α is small,
so the drag effects are not very noticeable over short times (because if we include
the next term in the expansion for v, we obtain v(t) ≈ −gt + αgt2/2). Large dense
objects therefore all fall at roughly the same rate, with an acceleration essentially
equal to g. But if the air were much thicker, then all the α’s would be larger, and
maybe it would have taken Galileo a bit longer to come to his conclusions.

What would you have thought, Galileo,
If instead you dropped cows and did say, “Oh!

3.4 Projectile motion

65

To lessen the sound
Of the moos from the ground,
They should fall not through air, but through mayo!”16 ♣

3.4 Projectile motion

Consider a ball thrown through the air, not necessarily vertically. We will neglect
air resistance in the following discussion. Things get a bit more complicated
when this is included, as Exercise 3.53 demonstrates.

Let x and y be the horizontal and vertical positions, respectively. The force
in the x direction is Fx = 0, and the force in the y direction is Fy = −mg. So
F = ma gives

¨x = 0,

and

¨y = −g.

(3.35)

Note that these two equations are “decoupled.” That is, there is no mention
of y in the equation for ¨x, and vice versa. The motions in the x and y direc-
tions are therefore completely independent. The classic demonstration of the
independence of the x and y motions is the following. Fire a bullet horizon-
tally (or, preferably, just imagine firing a bullet horizontally), and at the same
time drop a bullet from the height of the gun. Which bullet will hit the ground
first? (Neglect air resistance, the curvature of the earth, etc.) The answer is that
they will hit the ground at the same time, because the effect of gravity on the
two y motions is exactly the same, independent of what is going on in the x
direction.

If the initial position and velocity are (X , Y ) and (Vx, Vy), then we can easily

integrate Eq. (3.35) to obtain

˙x(t) = Vx,

and

˙y(t) = Vy − gt.

(3.36)

Integrating again gives

x(t) = X + Vxt,

and

y(t) = Y + Vyt − 1
2

gt2.

(3.37)

These equations for the speeds and positions are all you need to solve a projectile
problem.

16 It’s actually much more likely that Galileo obtained his “all objects fall at the same rate in a
vacuum” result by rolling balls down planes than by dropping balls from the Tower of Pisa; see
Adler and Coulter (1978). So I suppose this limerick is relevant only in the approximation of the
proverbial spherical cow.

66

Using F =ma

Example (Throwing a ball):

(a) For a given initial speed, at what inclination angle should a ball be thrown
so that it travels the maximum horizontal distance by the time it returns to the
ground? Assume that the ground is horizontal, and that the ball is released from
ground level.

(b) What is the optimal angle if the ground is sloped upward at an angle β (or

downward, if β is negative)?

Solution:

(a) Let the inclination angle be θ, and let the initial speed be V . Then the horizontal
speed is always Vx = V cos θ, and the initial vertical speed is Vy = V sin θ.
The first thing we need to do is find the time t in the air. We know that the
vertical speed is zero at time t/2, because the ball is moving horizontally at
the highest point. So the second of Eqs. (3.36) gives Vy = g(t/2). Therefore,
t = 2Vy/g. 17 The first of Eqs. (3.37) tells us that the horizontal distance
traveled is d = Vxt. Using t = 2Vy/g in this gives

d =

2VxVy
g

= V 2(2 sin θ cos θ)
g

= V 2 sin 2θ
g

.

(3.38)

The sin 2θ factor has a maximum at θ = π/4. The maximum horizontal
distance traveled is then dmax = V 2/g.

Remark: For θ = π/4, you can show that the maximum height achieved is V 2/4g.
This is half the maximum height of V 2/2g (as you can show) if the ball is thrown
straight up. Note that any possible distance you might want to find in this problem
must be proportional to V 2/g, by dimensional analysis. The only question is what
the numerical factor is. ♣

(b) As in part (a), the first thing we need to do is find the time t in the air. If the
ground is sloped at an angle β, then the equation for the line of the ground is
y = (tan β)x. The path of the ball is given in terms of t by
y = (V sin θ)t − 1
2

x = (V cos θ)t,

(3.39)

gt2,

and

where θ is the angle of the throw, as measured with respect to the horizontal
(not the ground). We must solve for the t that makes y = (tan β)x, because this
gives the time when the path of the ball intersects the line of the ground. Using
Eq. (3.39), we find that y = (tan β)x when

t = 2V
g

(sin θ − tan β cos θ).

(3.40)

17 Alternatively, the time of flight can be found from the second of Eqs. (3.37), which says that the
ball returns to the ground when Vyt = gt2/2. We will have to use this second strategy in part (b),
where the trajectory is not symmetric around the maximum.

3.4 Projectile motion

67

(There is, of course, also the solution t = 0.) Plugging this into the expression
for x in Eq. (3.39) gives

x = 2V 2
g

(sin θ cos θ − tan β cos2θ).

(3.41)

We must now maximize this value for x, which is equivalent to maximizing
the distance along the slope. Setting the derivative with respect to θ equal to
zero, and using the double-angle formulas, sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ and cos 2θ =
cos2θ − sin2θ , we find tan β = − cot 2θ . This can be rewritten as tan β =
− tan(π/2 − 2θ ). Therefore, β = −(π/2 − 2θ), so we have

θ = 1
2

(cid:7)

β +

(cid:8)

.

π

2

(3.42)

In other words, the throwing angle should bisect the angle between the ground
and the vertical.

Remarks:

1. For β ≈ π/2, we have θ ≈ π/2, as should be the case. For β = 0, we have
θ = π/4, as we found in part (a). And for β ≈ −π/2, we have θ ≈ 0, which makes
sense.

2. A quicker method of obtaining the time in Eq. (3.40) is the following. Consider the set
of tilted axes parallel and perpendicular to the ground; let these be the x(cid:16) and y(cid:16) axes,
respectively. The initial velocity in the y(cid:16) direction is V sin(θ −β), and the acceleration
in this direction is g cos β. The time in the air is twice the time it takes the ball to reach
the maximum “height” above the ground (measured in the y(cid:16) direction), which occurs
when the velocity in the y(cid:16) direction is instantaneously zero. The total time is therefore
2V sin(θ − β)/(g cos β), which you can show is equivalent to the time in Eq. (3.40).
Note that the g sin β acceleration in the x(cid:16) direction is irrelevant in calculating this
time. In the present example, using these tilted axes doesn’t save a huge amount of
time, but in some situations (see Exercise 3.50) the tilted axes can save you a lot
of grief.

3. An interesting fact about the motion of the ball in the maximum-distance case is that
the initial and final velocities are perpendicular to each other. The demonstration of
this is the task of Problem 3.16.

4. Substituting the value of θ from Eq. (3.42) into Eq. (3.41), you can show (after a bit

of algebra) that the maximum distance traveled along the tilted ground is

d = x
cos β

= V 2/g

1 + sin β .

(3.43)

Solving for V , we have V 2 = g(d + d sin β). This can be interpreted as saying that
the minimum speed at which a ball must be thrown in order to pass over a wall of
height h, at a distance L away on level ground, is given by V 2 = g(
L2 + h2 + h).
This checks in the limits of h → 0 and L → 0.

√

5. A compilation of many other projectile results can be found in Buckmaster

(1985). ♣

68

Using F =ma

Along with the bullet example mentioned above, another classic example of
the independence of the x and y motions is the “hunter and monkey” problem.
In it, a hunter aims an arrow (a toy one, of course) at a monkey hanging from
a branch in a tree. The monkey, thinking he’s being clever, tries to avoid the
arrow by letting go of the branch right when he sees the arrow released. The
unfortunate consequence of this action is that he in fact will get hit, because
gravity acts on both him and the arrow in the same way; they both fall the same
distance relative to where they would have been if there were no gravity. And
the monkey would get hit in such a case, because the arrow is initially aimed at
him. You can work this out in Exercise 3.44, in a more peaceful setting involving
fruit.

If a monkey lets go of a tree,
The arrow will hit him, you see,

3.5 Motion in a plane, polar coordinates

r

y

When dealing with problems where the motion lies in a plane, it is often conve-
nient to work with polar coordinates, r and θ. These are related to the Cartesian
coordinates by (see Fig. 3.7)

θ

x

Fig. 3.7

x = r cos θ,

and

y = r sin θ.

(3.44)

Depending on the problem, either Cartesian or polar coordinates are easier to
use. It is usually clear from the setup which is better. For example, if the problem
involves circular motion, then polar coordinates are a good bet. But to use polar
coordinates, we need to know what Newton’s second law looks like when written
in terms of them. Therefore, the goal of the present section is to determine what
F = ma ≡ m¨r looks like when written in terms of polar coordinates.

At a given position r in the plane, the basis vectors in polar coordinates are
ˆr, which is a unit vector pointing in the radial direction; and ˆθ, which is a unit
vector pointing in the counterclockwise tangential direction. In polar coordinates,
a general vector may be written as

r = r ˆr.

(3.45)

Since the goal of this section is to find ¨r, we must, in view of Eq. (3.45), get
a handle on the time derivative of ˆr. And we’ll eventually need the derivative
of ˆθ, too. In contrast with the fixed Cartesian basis vectors (ˆx and ˆy), the polar
basis vectors (ˆr and ˆθ) change as a point moves around in the plane. We can

Taking the time derivative of these equations gives

˙ˆr = − sin θ ˙θ ˆx + cos θ ˙θ ˆy,
˙ˆθ = − cos θ ˙θ ˆx − sin θ ˙θ ˆy.

Fig. 3.8

(3.47)

Using Eq. (3.46), we arrive at the nice clean expressions,

˙ˆr = ˙θ ˆθ,

and

˙ˆθ = − ˙θ ˆr.

(3.48)

These relations are fairly evident if you look at what happens to the basis vectors
as r moves a tiny distance in the tangential direction. Note that the basis vectors
do not change as r moves in the radial direction. We can now start differentiating
Eq. (3.45). One derivative gives (yes, the product rule works fine here)

˙r = ˙r ˆr + r

˙ˆr = ˙r ˆr + r ˙θ ˆθ.

(3.49)

This makes sense, because ˙r is the velocity in the radial direction, and r ˙θ is the
velocity in the tangential direction, often written as rω (where ω ≡ ˙θ is the
angular velocity, or “angular frequency”).18 Differentiating Eq. (3.49) then gives

˙ˆθ

¨r = ¨r ˆr + ˙r

˙ˆr + ˙r ˙θ ˆθ + r ¨θ ˆθ + r ˙θ
= ¨r ˆr + ˙r( ˙θ ˆθ) + ˙r ˙θ ˆθ + r ¨θ ˆθ + r ˙θ(− ˙θ ˆr)
= (¨r − r ˙θ 2)ˆr + (r ¨θ + 2˙r ˙θ)ˆθ.

(3.50)

Finally, equating m¨r with F ≡ Fr ˆr + Fθ
forces as

ˆθ gives the radial and tangential

Fr = m(¨r − r ˙θ 2),
Fθ = m(r ¨θ + 2˙r ˙θ).

(3.51)

(See Exercise 3.67 for a slightly different derivation of these equations.) Let’s
look at each of the four terms on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (3.51).

18 For r ˙θ to be the tangential velocity, we must measure θ in radians and not degrees. Then rθ is by
definition the position along the circumference, so r ˙θ is the velocity along the circumference.

70

Using F =ma

• The m¨r term is quite intuitive. For radial motion, it simply states that F = ma along the

radial direction.

• The mr ¨θ term is also quite intuitive. For circular motion, it states that F = ma along
the tangential direction, because r ¨θ is the second derivative of the distance rθ along the
circumference.

• The −mr ˙θ 2 term is also fairly clear. For circular motion, it says that the radial force
is −m(r ˙θ )2/r = −mv2/r, which is the familiar force that causes the centripetal accel-
eration, v2/r. See Problem 3.20 for an alternate (and quicker) derivation of this v2/r
result.

• The 2m˙r ˙θ term isn’t so obvious. It is associated with the Coriolis force. There are
various ways to look at this term. One is that it exists in order to keep angular momentum
conserved. We’ll have a great deal to say about the Coriolis force in Chapter 10.

Example (Circular pendulum): A mass hangs from a massless string of length
(cid:2). Conditions have been set up so that the mass swings around in a horizontal circle,
with the string making a constant angle β with the vertical (see Fig. 3.9). What is the
angular frequency, ω, of this motion?

Solution: The mass travels in a circle, so the horizontal radial force must be
Fr = mr ˙θ 2 ≡ mrω2 (with r = (cid:2) sin β), directed radially inward. The forces on
the mass are the tension in the string, T , and gravity, mg (see Fig. 3.10). There is no
acceleration in the vertical direction, so F = ma in the vertical and radial directions
gives, respectively,

Does the ball spend more time or less time in the air than it would if it
were thrown in vacuum?

3.13. Balancing a pencil ***

Consider a pencil that stands upright on its tip and then falls over. Let’s
idealize the pencil as a mass m sitting at the end of a massless rod of
length (cid:2).20

(a) Assume that the pencil makes an initial (small) angle θ0 with the
vertical, and that its initial angular speed is ω0. The angle will
eventually become large, but while it is small (so that sin θ ≈ θ),
what is θ as a function of time?

(b) You might think that it should be possible (theoretically, at least)
to make the pencil balance for an arbitrarily long time, by mak-
ing the initial θ0 and ω0 sufficiently small. However, it turns out
that due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (which puts a con-
straint on how well we can know the position and momentum of

19 Assume that the hole is actually a short frictionless tube bent into a gradual right angle, so that
the chain’s horizontal momentum doesn’t cause it to overshoot the hole. For a description of what
happens in a similar problem when this constraint is removed, see Calkin (1989).

20 It actually involves only a trivial modification to do the problem correctly using the moment of
inertia and the torque. But the point-mass version is quite sufficient for the present purposes.

a particle), it is impossible to balance the pencil for more than a
certain amount of time. The point is that you can’t be sure that
the pencil is initially both at the top and at rest. The goal of this
problem is to be quantitative about this. The time limit is sure to
surprise you.

Without getting into quantum mechanics, let’s just say that
the uncertainty principle says (up to factors of order 1) that
(cid:16)x(cid:16)p ≥ (cid:1), where (cid:1) = 1.05 · 10−34 J s is Planck’s constant.
The implications of this are somewhat vague, but we’ll just take
it to mean that the initial conditions satisfy ((cid:2)θ0)(m(cid:2)ω0) ≥ (cid:1).
With this constraint, your task is to find the maximum time it
can take your θ(t) solution in part (a) to become of order 1. In
other words, determine (roughly) the maximum time the pencil
can balance. Assume m = 0.01 kg, and (cid:2) = 0.1 m.

3.14. Maximum trajectory area *

A ball is thrown at speed v from zero height on level ground. At
what angle should it be thrown so that the area under the trajectory
is maximum?

3.15. Bouncing ball *

A ball is thrown straight upward so that it reaches a height h. It falls
down and bounces repeatedly. After each bounce, it returns to a certain
fraction f of its previous height. Find the total distance traveled, and
also the total time, before it comes to rest. What is its average speed?

A ball is thrown with speed v from the edge of a cliff of height h. At
what inclination angle should it be thrown so that it travels the maximum
horizontal distance? What is this maximum distance? Assume that the
ground below the cliff is horizontal.

21 You can grind through this problem and explicitly find the final angle, but there’s a quicker way.
This quicker method makes use of the conservation-of-energy statement that the difference in the
squares of the initial and final speeds depends only on the change in height (the relation happens
to be v2
= 2gh, but you don’t need this actual expression). Hint: Consider the reverse path.

What should y and θ be so that the ball travels the maximum horizontal
distance by the time it hits the ground?

3.21. Vertical acceleration **

A bead rests at the top of a fixed frictionless hoop of radius R that lies in
a vertical plane. The bead is given a tiny push so that it slides down and
around the hoop. At what points on the hoop is the bead’s acceleration
vertical?22 What is this vertical acceleration? Note: We haven’t studied
conservation of energy yet, but use the fact that the bead’s speed after it
has fallen a height h is given by v =

A mass, which is free to move on a horizontal frictionless surface, is
attached to one end of a massless string that wraps partially around a
frictionless vertical pole of radius r (see the top view in Fig. 3.17). You
hold on to the other end of the string. At t = 0, the mass has speed v0 in
the tangential direction along the dotted circle of radius R shown. Your
task is to pull on the string so that the mass keeps moving along the

your hand around the pole, of course.) What is the speed of the mass as
a function of time? There is a special value of the time; what is it and
why is it special?

Consider a particle that feels an angular force only, of the form Fθ =
m˙r ˙θ. Show that ˙r =
A ln r + B, where A and B are constants of
integration, determined by the initial conditions. (There’s nothing all
that physical about this force. It simply makes the F = ma equations
solvable.)

3.24. Free particle ***

Consider a free particle in a plane. With Cartesian coordinates, it is easy
to use F = ma to show that the particle moves in a straight line. The
task of this problem is to demonstrate this result in a much more cum-
bersome way, using polar coordinates and Eq. (3.51). More precisely,
show that cos θ = r0/r for a free particle, where r0 is the radius at
closest approach to the origin, and θ is measured with respect to this
radius.

3.35. Leaving the sphere **

A small mass rests on top of a fixed sphere of radius R. The coefficient
of friction is µ. The mass is given a sideways kick that produces an
initial angular speed ω0. Let θ be the angle down from the top of the
sphere. In terms of θ and its derivatives, what is the tangential F = ma
equation? Depending on the value of ω0, the mass either comes to rest
on the sphere or flies off it. If g = 10 m/s2, R = 1 m, and µ = 1,
write a program to numerically determine the minimum ω0 for which
the mass leaves the sphere. For this cutoff case, give the angle at which
the mass loses contact, and describe (roughly) what the plot of ˙θ versus
θ looks like. See Prior and Mele (2007) for the exact solution for ˙θ in
terms of θ.

3.36. Comparing the times ***

A block of mass m is projected up along the surface of a plane inclined
at an angle θ. The initial speed is v0, and the coefficients of static and
kinetic friction are both equal to µ. The block reaches a highest point
and then slides back down to the starting point.

(a) Show that for the block to in fact slide back down instead of
remaining at rest at the highest point, tan θ must be greater than µ.
(b) Assuming that tan θ > µ, is the total up and down time longer
or shorter than the total time it would take if the plane were
frictionless? Or does the answer depend on what θ and µ are?
(c) Assuming that tan θ > µ, show that for a given θ, the value of µ
that yields the minimum total time is given by µ ≈ (0.397) tan θ.
(You will need to solve something numerically.) This minimum
time turns out to be about 90% of the time it would take if the
plane were frictionless.

maximum horizontal distance? What is this maximum distance?

3.41. Throwing in the wind *

A ball is thrown horizontally to the right, from the top of a vertical
cliff of height h. A wind blows horizontally to the left, and assume
(simplistically) that the effect of the wind is to provide a constant force
to the left, equal in magnitude to the weight of the ball. How fast should
the ball be thrown so that it lands at the foot of the cliff?

3.42. Throwing in the wind again *

A ball is thrown eastward across level ground. A wind blows horizontally
to the east, and assume (simplistically) that the effect of the wind is to
provide a constant force to the east, equal in magnitude to the weight of
the ball. At what angle θ should the ball be thrown so that it travels the

3.43. Increasing gravity *

At t = 0 on the planet Gravitus Increasicus, a projectile is fired with
speed v0 at an angle θ above the horizontal. This planet is a strange
one, in that the acceleration due to gravity increases linearly with time,
starting with a value of zero when the projectile is fired. In other words,
g(t) = βt, where β is a given constant. What horizontal distance does
the projectile travel? What should θ be to maximize this distance?

magnitude of the initial drag force equal to the weight of the

A large number of masses are attached by strings of various lengths to a
point on the ceiling. All of the masses swing around in horizontal circles

instant when all the masses lie in the plane of the paper (as shown for
four masses), what does the “curve” formed by the masses look like?

Two masses m are attached to two vertices of an equilateral triangle
made of three massless rods of length (cid:2). A pivot is located at the third
vertex, and the triangle is free to swing back and forth in a vertical plane,
as shown in Fig. 3.34. If it is initially released from rest when one of the
rods is vertical (as shown), find the tensions in all three rods (and specify
tension or compression), and also the accelerations of the masses, at the

Consider the circular pendulum in the example in Section 3.5. Let the
x-y plane be the horizontal plane of the circle. For small β, what (approx-
imately) is the Fx component of the force on the mass when it is at the
position (x, y) on the circle?

Consider now a standard plane pendulum where the mass swings back
and forth in the vertical plane containing the x axis. Let the maximum
angle of the pendulum be the same small angle β. 24 What (approxi-
mately) is the Fx component of the force on the mass in terms of its x
coordinate?

Your two results should be the same, which means that the x motions
of the two systems are the same, because when they are each at their
maximum x value ((cid:2) sin β), they have the same x speed (zero), and we
just showed that they always have the same x acceleration, independent
of any y motion. So the frequencies of the two systems must be equal.

If you paint a dot on the rim of a rolling wheel, the coordinates of the
dot may be written as25

24 It’s actually not required that this be the same angle, as long as it’s small. See Problem 3.10.
25 This follows from writing (x, y) as (Rθ, R) + (R sin θ, R cos θ). The first term here is the position
of the center of the wheel, and the second term is the position of the dot relative to the center,
where θ is measured clockwise from the top.

The path of the dot is called a cycloid. Assume that the wheel is rolling
at constant speed, which implies θ = ωt.

particle starts with ˙θ (cid:13)= 0 and ˙r > 0, it reaches r = ∞ in a finite time.

Consider a particle that feels an angular force only, of the form Fθ =

integration, determined by the initial conditions. (This force is actually
a physical one. If you put a bead on a stick and swing the stick around
one end at a constant rate, then the normal force from the stick happens
to be 2m˙r ˙θ.26)

also be considered to be physical. They correspond to putting a bead on a stick and swinging the
stick around with angular speeds proportional to the bead’s r or 1/r, respectively (as is evident
from the values of ˙θ in the solutions). This can also be deduced from τ = dL/dt, but we won’t
get to torque until Chapter 8.

initial speed is v0, and if the coefficient of kinetic friction between the

want to write a as v dv/dx), and then demand that the magnitude
of the friction force equals µmg in the optimal case. Take it from
there.

(b) Let the friction force make an angle β(t) with respect to the tan-
gential direction. Write down the radial and tangential F = ma
equations (you’ll want to write a as dv/dt), and then take the
derivative of the radial equation. Take it from there (this is the
slick way).

3.8 Solutions

3.1. Atwood’s machine

Let T be the tension in the string, and let a be the acceleration of m1 (with upward
taken to be positive). Then −a is the acceleration of m2. So the F = ma equations are

T − m1g = m1a,

and T − m2g = m2(−a).

(3.57)

Solving these two equations for a and T gives

a =

(m2 − m1)g
m2 + m1

,

and T = 2m1m2g
m2 + m1

.

(3.58)

Remarks: As a double-check, a has the correct limits when m2 (cid:6) m1, m1 (cid:6) m2,
and m2 = m1 (namely a ≈ g, a ≈ −g, and a = 0, respectively). As far as T goes, if
m1 = m2 ≡ m, then T = mg, as it should. And if m1 (cid:4) m2, then T ≈ 2m1g. This is
correct, because it makes the net upward force on m1 equal to m1g, which means that
its acceleration is g upward, which is consistent with the fact that m2 is essentially in
free fall. ♣

3.2. Double Atwood’s machine

Let the tension in the lower string be T . Then the tension in the upper string is 2T (by
balancing the forces on the bottom pulley). The three F = ma equations are therefore
(with all the a’s taken to be positive upward)

2T − m1g = m1a1,

T − m2g = m2a2,

T − m3g = m3a3.

(3.59)

And conservation of string says that the acceleration of m1 is

a1 = −

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

a2 + a3
2

.

(3.60)

This follows from the fact that the average position of m2 and m3 moves the same
distance as the bottom pulley, which in turn moves the same distance (but in the
opposite direction) as m1. We now have four equations in the four unknowns, a1, a2,
a3, and T . With a little work, we can solve for the accelerations,

a1 = g

a2 = −g

a3 = −g

4m2m3 − m1(m2 + m3)
4m2m3 + m1(m2 + m3) ,
4m2m3 + m1(m2 − 3m3)
4m2m3 + m1(m2 + m3) ,
4m2m3 + m1(m3 − 3m2)
4m2m3 + m1(m2 + m3) .

(3.61)

Remarks: There are many limits we can check here. A couple are: (1) If m2 = m3 =
m1/2, then all the a’s are zero, which is correct. (2) If m3 is much less than both m1 and
m2, then a1 = −g, a2 = −g, and a3 = 3g. To understand this 3g, convince yourself
that if m1 and m2 go down by d, then m3 goes up by 3d.

Note that a1 can be written as

(cid:2)

a1 = g

4m2m3

− m1

(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:2)

(cid:3)

+ m1

.

4m2m3
m2 + m3

(3.62)

In view of the result for a in Eq. (3.58) in Problem 3.1, we see that as far as m1 is
concerned here, the m2, m3 pulley system acts just like a mass of 4m2m3/(m2 + m3).
This has the expected properties of equaling zero when either m2 or m3 is zero, and
equaling 2m if m2 = m3 ≡ m.

♣

3.3. Infinite Atwood’s machine

First solution:
If the strength of gravity on the earth were multiplied by a factor
η, then the tension in all of the strings in the Atwood’s machine would likewise be
multiplied by η. This is true because the only way to produce a quantity with the units
of tension (that is, force) is to multiply a mass by g. Conversely, if we put the Atwood’s
machine on another planet and discover that all of the tensions are multiplied by η,
then we know that the gravity there must be ηg.

Let the tension in the string above the first pulley be T . Then the tension in the string
above the second pulley is T /2 (because the pulley is massless). Let the downward
acceleration of the second pulley be a2. Then the second pulley effectively lives in a
world where gravity has strength g − a2. Consider the subsystem of all the pulleys
except the top one. This infinite subsystem is identical to the original infinite system
of all the pulleys. Therefore, by the arguments in the above paragraph, we must have
= T /2
g − a2

(3.63)

T
g

,

which gives a2 = g/2. But a2 is also the acceleration of the top mass, so our answer
is g/2.

Remarks: You can show that the relative acceleration of the second and third pulleys
is g/4, and that of the third and fourth is g/8, etc. The acceleration of a mass far down
in the system therefore equals g(1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + · · · ) = g, which makes intuitive
sense.

Note that T = 0 also makes Eq. (3.63) true. But this corresponds to putting a mass

of zero at the end of a finite pulley system (see the following solution). ♣

Second solution: Consider the following auxiliary problem.

Problem: Two setups are shown in Fig. 3.38. The first contains a hanging mass m.
The second contains two masses, m1 and m2, hanging over a pulley. Let both supports
have acceleration as downward. What should m be, in terms of m1 and m2, so that the
tension T in the top string is the same in both cases?

m m

Answer:

In the first case, we have

mg − T = mas.
In the second case, let a be the acceleration of m2 relative to the support (with downward
taken to be positive). Then we have
m1g − T
2

= m2(as + a).
If we define g(cid:16) ≡ g − as, then we may write the above three equations as
(cid:16) − T

and m2g − T

= −m1a, m2g

(cid:16) = T , m1g

= m1(as − a),

(cid:16) − T

= m2a.

(3.65)

(3.64)

(3.66)

mg

Eliminating a from the last two of these equations gives T = 4m1m2g(cid:16)/(m1 + m2).
Using this value of T in the first equation then gives

m = 4m1m2
m1 + m2

.

(3.67)

Note that the value of as is irrelevant. We effectively have a fixed support in a world
where the acceleration due to gravity is g(cid:16) (see Eq. (3.66)), and the desired m can’t
depend on g(cid:16), by dimensional analysis. This auxiliary problem shows that for any as
the two-mass system in the second case can equivalently be treated like a mass m,
given by Eq. (3.67), as far as the upper string is concerned. (cid:1)

Now let’s look at our infinite Atwood’s machine. Assume that the system has N pulleys,
where N → ∞. Let the bottom mass be x. Then the auxiliary problem shows that the
bottom two masses, m and x, can be treated like an effective mass f (x), where

f (x) = 4mx
m + x

=

4x
1 + (x/m) .

(3.68)

We can then treat the combination of the mass f (x) and the next m as an effective
mass f (f (x)). These iterations can be repeated, until we finally have a mass m and a
mass f (N −1)(x) hanging over the top pulley. So we must determine the behavior of
f N (x), as N → ∞. This behavior is clear if we look at the plot of f (x) in Fig. 3.39.
We see that x = 3m is a fixed point of f (x). That is, f (3m) = 3m. This plot shows
that no matter what x we start with, the iterations approach 3m (unless we start at
x = 0, in which case we remain there). These iterations are shown graphically by the
directed lines in the plot. After reaching the value f (x) on the curve, the line moves
horizontally to the x value of f (x), and then vertically to the value f (f (x)) on the curve,
and so on. Therefore, since f N (x) → 3m as N → ∞, our infinite Atwood’s machine
is equivalent to (as far as the top mass is concerned) just two masses, m and 3m. You
can then quickly show that the acceleration of the top mass is g/2. Note that as far
as the support is concerned, the whole apparatus is equivalent to a mass 3m. So 3mg
is the upward force exerted by the support.

3.4. Line of pulleys

Let m be the common mass, and let T be the tension in the string. Let a be the
acceleration of the end masses, and let a(cid:16) be the acceleration of the other N masses,
with upward taken to be positive. These N accelerations are indeed all equal, because
the same net force acts on all of the internal N masses, namely 2T upwards and mg
downwards. The F = ma equations for the end and internal masses are, respectively,

T − mg = ma,

and

(cid:16)
2T − mg = ma

But the string has fixed length. Therefore,

N (2a

(cid:16)) + a + a = 0.

(3.70)

The “2” here comes from the fact that if one of the inside masses goes up by a distance
d, then a length 2d of string has disappeared and must therefore appear somewhere
else (namely, in the outer two segments). Eliminating T from Eq. (3.69) gives a(cid:16) =
2a + g. Combining this with Eq. (3.70) then gives

a = − Ng

2N + 1

,

and

(cid:16) =

.

(3.71)

Remarks: For N = 1, we have a = −g/3 and a(cid:16) = g/3. For larger N , a increases
in magnitude and approaches −g/2 as N → ∞, and a(cid:16) decreases in magnitude and
approaches zero as N → ∞. The signs of a and a(cid:16) in Eq. (3.71) may be surprising.
You might think that if, say, N = 100, then these 100 masses will “win” out over the
two end masses, so that the N masses will fall. But this is not correct, because there
are many (2N , in fact) tensions acting up on the N masses. They do not behave like
a mass Nm hanging below one pulley. In fact, two masses of m/2 on the ends will
balance any number N of masses m in the interior (with the help of the upward forces
from the top row of pulleys).

♣

3.5. Ring of pulleys

Let T be the tension in the string. Then F = ma for mi gives

2T − mig = miai,

(3.72)

with upward taken to be positive. The ai’s are related by the fact that the string has
fixed length, which implies that the sum of the displacements of all the masses is zero.
In other words,

a1 + a2 + · · · + aN = 0.

(3.73)

88

Using F =ma

If we divide Eq. (3.72) by mi, and then add the N such equations together and use
Eq. (3.73), we find that T is given by

Remark: A few special cases are: If all the masses are equal, then all the ai = 0.
If mk = 0 (and all the others are not zero), then ak = (N − 1)g, and all the other
ai = −g. If N − 1 of the masses are equal and much smaller than the remaining one,
mk , then mk ≈ −g, and all the other ai ≈ g/(N − 1). ♣

3.6. Sliding down a plane

(a) The component of gravity along the plane is g sin θ . The acceleration in the
horizontal direction is therefore ax = (g sin θ ) cos θ . Our goal is to maximize
ax. By taking the derivative, or by noting that sin θ cos θ = (sin 2θ )/2, we obtain
θ = π/4. The maximum ax is then g/2.

(b) The normal force from the plane is mg cos θ , so the kinetic friction force is
µmg cos θ. The acceleration along the plane is therefore g(sin θ − µ cos θ ), and
so the acceleration in the horizontal direction is ax = g(sin θ − µ cos θ ) cos θ .
We want to maximize this. Setting the derivative equal to zero gives

(cos2θ − sin2θ ) + 2µ sin θ cos θ = 0 =⇒ cos 2θ + µ sin 2θ = 0

=⇒ tan 2θ = − 1
µ .

(3.77)

For µ → 0, this gives the π/4 result in part (a). For µ → ∞, we obtain θ ≈ π/2,
which makes sense.

Remarks: The time to travel a horizontal distance d is obtained from axt2/2 =
d/g. In part (b), you can show
d. In part (a), this gives a minimum time of 2

3.7. Sliding sideways on a plane

The normal force from the plane is N = mg cos θ . Therefore, the friction force on the
block is µN = (tan θ )(mg cos θ ) = mg sin θ . This force acts in the direction opposite
to the motion. The block also feels the gravitational force of mg sin θ pointing down
the plane.

Because the magnitudes of the friction force and the gravitational force along the
plane are equal, the acceleration along the direction of motion equals the negative of
the acceleration in the direction down the plane. Therefore, in a small increment of
time, the speed that the block loses along its direction of motion exactly equals the
speed that it gains in the direction down the plane. Letting v be the total speed of the

3.8 Solutions

89

block, and letting vy be the component of the velocity in the direction down the plane,
we therefore have

v + vy = C,
(3.78)
where C is a constant. C is given by its initial value, which is V + 0 = V . The final
value of C is Vf + Vf = 2Vf (where Vf is the final speed of the block), because the
block is essentially moving straight down the plane after a very long time. Therefore,
2Vf = V =⇒ Vf = V
2

(3.79)

.

3.8. Moving plane

Let N be the normal force between the block and the plane. Note that we cannot assume
that N = mg cos θ, because the plane recoils. We can see that N = mg cos θ is in fact
incorrect, because in the limiting case where M = 0, we have no normal force at all.
The various F = ma equations (vertical and horizontal for the block, and horizontal

for the plane) are

mg − N cos θ = may,
N sin θ = max,
N sin θ = MAx,

(3.80)

where we have chosen the positive directions for ay, ax, and Ax to be downward,
rightward, and leftward, respectively. There are four unknowns here: ax, ay, Ax, and
N , so we need one more equation. This fourth equation is the constraint that the block
remains in contact with the plane. The horizontal distance between the block and its
starting point on the plane is (ax + Ax)t2/2, and the vertical distance is ayt2/2. The
ratio of these distances must equal tan θ if the block is to remain on the plane (imagine
looking at things in the frame of the plane). Therefore, we must have

ay
ax + Ax

= tan θ.

(3.81)

Using Eq. (3.80) to solve for ay, ax, and Ax in terms of N , and then plugging the results
into Eq. (3.81), gives

(In the limit M → ∞, this reduces to N = mg cos θ , as it should.) Having found N ,

M + m sin2θ

Ax = N sin θ

Remarks:

√

1. For given M and m, you can show that the angle θ0 that maximizes Ax is tan θ0 =
M /(M + m). If M (cid:4) m, then θ0 ≈ 0; this makes sense, because the plane gets
squeezed out very fast. If M (cid:6) m, then θ0 ≈ π/4; this is consistent with the π/4
result from Problem 3.6(a).

2. In the limit M (cid:4) m, Eq. (3.83) gives Ax ≈ g/ tan θ . This makes sense, because
m falls essentially straight down with acceleration g, and the plane gets squeezed
out to the left.

3. In the limit M (cid:6) m, Eq. (3.83) gives Ax ≈ g(m/M ) sin θ cos θ . The correctness
of this is more transparent if we instead look at ax = (M /m)Ax ≈ g sin θ cos θ .
Since the plane is essentially at rest in this limit, this value of ax implies that the
acceleration of m along the plane equals ax/ cos θ ≈ g sin θ , as expected. ♣

3.9. Exponential force

F = ma gives ¨x = a0e−bt. Integrating this with respect to time gives v(t) =
−a0e−bt/b + A. Integrating again gives x(t) = a0e−bt/b2 + At + B. The initial condi-
tion v(0) = 0 gives −a0/b + A = 0 =⇒ A = a0/b. And the initial condition x(0) = 0
gives a0/b2 + B = 0 =⇒ B = −a0/b2. Therefore,

x(t) = a0

(3.84)

For t → ∞ (more precisely, for bt → ∞), v approaches a0/b, and x approaches
a0(t/b−1/b2). We see that the particle eventually lags a distance a0/b2 behind another
particle that starts at the same position but moves with the constant speed v = a0/b.
For t ≈ 0 (more precisely, for bt ≈ 0), we can expand e−bt in its Taylor series to
obtain x(t) ≈ a0t2/2. This makes sense, because the exponential factor in the force is
essentially equal to 1, so we essentially have a constant force with constant acceleration.

3.10. −kx force

This is simply a Hooke’s-law spring force, which we’ll see much more of in Chapter 4.

3.11. Falling chain

Let the density of the chain be ρ, and let y(t) be the length hanging down through the
hole at time t. Then the total mass is ρ(cid:2), and the mass hanging below the hole is ρy.
The net downward force on the chain is (ρy)g, so F = ma gives

ρgy = (ρ(cid:2))¨y =⇒ ¨y = g

(cid:2) y.

(3.89)

At this point, there are two ways we can proceed:

hangs below the hole is

speed at time T is
the subject of Chapter 5). Also, you can show that Eq. (3.91) implies that T goes to
infinity logarithmically as η0 → 0.

The integral on the left-hand side is cosh−1(y/y0), so we arrive at y(t) = y0 cosh(αt),

way to obtain the final speed with this method is to simply use the result for v in
Eq. (3.94). This tells us that the speed of the chain when it leaves the table (that is,
when y = (cid:2)) is v = α

0, in agreement with Eq. (3.93).

3.12. Throwing a beach ball

On both the way up and the way down, the total force on the ball is

F = −mg − mαv.

(3.96)

On the way up, v is positive, so the drag force points downward, as it should. And on
the way down, v is negative, so the drag force points upward. Our strategy for finding
vf will be to produce two different expressions for the maximum height h, and then
equate them. We’ll find these two expressions by considering the upward and then
the downward motion of the ball. In doing so, we will need to write the acceleration
of the ball as a = v dv/dy. For the upward motion, F = ma gives

vf ≈ g/α, because the argument of the log must be very small in order to give a very
large negative number, which is needed to produce a positive h on the left-hand side.
There is no way to relate vf and h in this limit, because the ball quickly reaches the
terminal velocity of −g/α (which is the velocity that makes the net force equal to zero),
independent of h. ♣

Let’s now find the times it takes for the ball to go up and to go down. We’ll present
two methods for doing this.
First method: Let T1 be the time for the upward path. If we write the acceleration
of the ball as a = dv/dt, then F = ma gives −mg − mαv = m dv/dt. Separating
variables and integrating yields

(3.105)

where we have used Eq. (3.101). This result is shorter than the time in vacuum (namely
2v0/g) because vf < v0.
Second method: The very simple form of Eq. (3.105) suggests that there is a cleaner
way of deriving it. And indeed, if we integrate m dv/dt = −mg − mαv with respect to
time on the way up, we obtain −v0 = −gT1 − αh (because
v dt = h). Likewise, if
we integrate m dv/dt = −mg − mαv with respect to time on the way down, we obtain
(cid:17)
−vf = −gT2 + αh (because
v dt = −h). Adding these two results gives Eq. (3.105).
Note that this procedure works only because the drag force is proportional to v.

Remark: The fact that the time here is shorter than the time in vacuum isn’t obvious.
On one hand, the ball doesn’t travel as high in air as it would in vacuum, so you might
think that T1 + T2 < 2v0/g. But on the other hand, the ball moves slower in air on
the way down, so you might think that T1 + T2 > 2v0/g. It isn’t obvious which effect
wins, without doing a calculation.28 For any α, you can use Eq. (3.103) to show that
T1 < v0/g. But T2 is harder to get a handle on, because it is given in terms of vf . But in
the limit of large α, the ball quickly reaches terminal velocity, so we have T2 ≈ h/vf .
Using the results from the previous remark, this becomes T2 ≈ (v0/α)/(g/α) =
v0/g. Interestingly, this equals the downward (and upward) time for a ball thrown
in vacuum. ♣

3.13. Balancing a pencil

(a) The component of gravity in the tangential direction is mg sin θ ≈ mgθ . There-
fore, the tangential F = ma equation is mgθ = m(cid:2) ¨θ , which may be written as
¨θ = (g/(cid:2))θ. The general solution to this equation is29

The constants A and B are found from the initial conditions,

(b) The constants A and B will turn out to be small (they will each be of order

θ of order 1, the negative exponential will have become negligible. We will
therefore ignore this term from here on. In other words,

θ(t) ≈ 1

The goal is to keep θ small for as long as possible. Hence, we want to minimize
the coefficient of the exponential, subject to the uncertainty-principle constraint,
((cid:2)θ0)(m(cid:2)ω0) ≥ (cid:1). This constraint gives ω0 ≥ (cid:1)/(m(cid:2)2θ0). Therefore,

No matter how clever you are, and no matter how much money you spend on
the newest cutting-edge pencil balancing equipment, you can never get a pencil
to balance for more than about four seconds.

Remarks:

1. The smallness of this answer is quite amazing. It is remarkable that a
quantum effect on a macroscopic object can produce an everyday value
for a time scale. Basically, the point is that the fast exponential growth of
θ (which gives rise to the log in the final result for t) wins out over the
smallness of (cid:1), and produces a result for t of order 1. When push comes to
shove, exponential effects always win.

2. The above value for t depends strongly on (cid:2) and g, through the

(cid:2)/g term.
But the dependence on m, (cid:2), and g in the log term is very weak, because (cid:1)
is so small. If m is increased by a factor of 1000, for example, the result for
t increases by only about 10%. This implies that any factors of order 1 that
we neglected throughout this problem are completely irrelevant. They will
appear in the argument of the log term, and will therefore have negligible
effect.

√

3. Note that dimensional analysis, which is generally a very powerful tool,
(cid:2)/g has dimensions
won’t get you too far in this problem. The quantity
of time, and the quantity η ≡ m2(cid:2)3g/(cid:1)2 is dimensionless (it is the only
such quantity), so the balancing time must take the form,

√

(cid:13)

t ≈

f (η),

(3.114)

where f is some function. If the leading term in f were a power (even, for
example, a square root), then t would essentially be infinite (t ≈ 1030 s ≈
1022 years for the square root). But f in fact turns out to be a log (which
you can’t know without solving the problem), which completely cancels
out the smallness of (cid:1), reducing an essentially infinite time down to a few
seconds. ♣

3.14. Maximum trajectory area

Let θ be the angle at which the ball is thrown. Then the coordinates are given by
x = (v cos θ)t and y = (v sin θ )t − gt2/2. The total time in the air is 2(v sin θ )/g, so
the area under the trajectory, A =

Taking the derivative of this, we find that the maximum occurs when tan θ =

that is, when θ = 60◦. The maximum area is then Amax =

dimensional analysis we know that the area, which has dimensions of distance squared,
must be proportional to v4/g2.

Remark: The average speed for f ≈ 1 is roughly half of the average speed for f ≈ 0.
This may seem counterintuitive, because in the f ≈ 0 case the ball slows down far
more quickly than in the f ≈ 1 case. But the f ≈ 0 case consists of essentially only
one bounce, and the average speed for that one bounce is the largest of any bounce.
Both D and T are smaller for f ≈ 0 than for f ≈ 1, but T is smaller by a larger
factor. ♣

3.16. Perpendicular velocities

In the maximum-distance case, let vi be the initial speed of the ball, and let vf be the
final speed right before it hits the plane (so vf =
− 2gh, where h is the final height
of the ball). Let the parabolic path be labeled P, and let the beginning and ending points
be A and B, as shown in Fig. 3.40.

v2
i

(cid:15)

Consider the question, “Given an initial speed vf , at what inclination angle should a
ball be thrown down the plane from point B so that it travels the maximum distance?”
The answer is that it should be thrown along the same path P, tracing out the path
backward. This is certainly a possible physical trajectory (reversing time still leads to
a solution to F = ma for projectile motion), and we claim that it does indeed yield the
maximum distance. This can be seen in the following way.

Assume (in search of a contradiction) that with initial speed vf , the maximum dis-
tance down the plane is obtained via some other path P(cid:16) that lands farther down the
plane, as shown in Fig. 3.40. Then if we decrease the initial speed vf by an appropriate
amount, we can have the ball land at point A via some path P(cid:16)(cid:16) (not shown, lest the
figure get too cluttered). From the conservation-of-energy result, the final speed at A
in this case is less than vi. But if we simply reverse the motion along path P(cid:16)(cid:16), we see
that we can get from A to B by using an initial speed that is less than vi. So if we then
increase the speed up to vi, we can hit a point above B on the plane via some other path
P(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16), contradicting the fact that B was the endpoint of the maximum-distance trajectory
starting at A with initial speed vi. This contradiction shows that the maximum distance
down the plane, starting at B with speed vf , must in fact be attained via the path P.

Now, from the example in Section 3.4, we know that in the maximum-distance case,
the throwing angle bisects the angle between the ground and the vertical. We therefore
have the situation shown in Fig. 3.41, because the same path gives the maximum
distance for both the upward and downward throws. Since 2α + 2γ = 180◦, we see
that α + γ = 90◦, as we wanted to show.

If h = 0, then θmax = π/4 and dmax = v2/g, in agreement with the example in Section
3.4. If h → ∞ or v → 0, then θmax ≈ 0, which makes sense.

Remark:
If we make use of conservation of energy (discussed in Chapter 5), it turns
out that the final speed of the ball when it hits the ground is vf =
v2 + 2gh. The
maximum distance in Eq. (3.123) can therefore be written as (with vi ≡ v being the
initial speed)

(cid:4)

dmax =

vivf
g

.

(3.124)

Note that this is symmetric in vi and vf , as it must be, because we could imagine
the trajectory running backward. Also, it equals zero if vi is zero, and it reduces to
v2/g on level ground, as it should. We can also write the angle θ in Eq. (3.122)
in terms of vf (instead of h). You can show that the result is tan θ = vi/vf . This
implies that the initial and final velocities are perpendicular to each other, because
running the trajectory backward interchanges vi and vf , which means that the product
of the tangents of the two angles equals 1. This is basically the same result as in
Problem 3.16. ♣

3.18. Redirected motion

First solution: We will use the results of Problem 3.17, namely Eqs. (3.123) and
(3.122), which say that an object projected from height y at speed v travels a maximum
horizontal distance of

(cid:1)

dmax =

(3.125)

and the optimal angle yielding this distance is

In the problem at hand, the object is dropped from height h, so the kinematic relation

v2
f
Eq. (3.125) tells us that the maximum horizontal distance, as a function of y, is

h(h − y).

(3.127)

3.8 Solutions

97

This is maximum when y = 0 (assuming we can’t have negative y), in which case the
distance is dmax = 2h. Equation (3.126) gives the associated optimal angle as θ = 45◦.
Second solution: Assume that the greatest distance d0 is obtained when the surface
is at y = y0. We will show that y0 must be 0. We will do this by assuming y0 (cid:13)= 0 and
explicitly constructing a situation that yields a greater distance.

Let P be the point where the ball finally hits the ground after it bounces off the
surface at height y0. Consider a second scenario where a ball is dropped from height
h directly above P. The speed of this ball at P will be the same as the speed of the
original ball at P. This follows from conservation of energy. (Or, since we haven’t
+ 2ad for the y speeds
covered energy yet, you can use the kinematic relation v2
f
of the two balls; apply it in two steps for the first ball.)

= v2
i

Now imagine putting a surface at P at the appropriate angle so that the second ball
bounces off in the direction from which the first ball came. Then the second ball will
travel backward along the parabolic trajectory of the first one. But this means that
after the second ball gets to the location of the platform at y0 (which we have now
removed), it will cover more horizontal distance before it hits the ground. We have
therefore constructed a setup in which the ball travels farther horizontally than in our
proposed maximal case. So the optimal setup must have y0 = 0, in which case the
example in Section 3.4 says that the optimal angle is θ = 45◦. If we want the ball to
go even farther, we can simply dig a (wide enough) hole in the ground and have the
ball bounce from the bottom of the hole.

3.19. Maximum trajectory length

Let θ be the angle at which the ball is thrown. Then the coordinates are given by
x = (v cos θ)t and y = (v sin θ)t − gt2/2. The ball reaches its maximum height at
t = v sin θ/g, so the length of the trajectory is

3.21. Vertical acceleration

Let θ be the angle down from the top of the hoop. The tangential acceleration is
at = g sin θ, and the radial acceleration is ar = v2/R = 2gh/R. But the height fallen
is h = R − R cos θ, so we have

ar = 2gR(1 − cos θ )

R

= 2g(1 − cos θ ).

(3.135)

We want the total acceleration to be vertical, which means that we want the horizontal
components of at and ar in Fig. 3.45 to cancel. That is, at cos θ = ar sin θ . This gives
(g sin θ) cos θ = 2g(1 − cos θ ) sin θ =⇒ sin θ = 0 or cos θ = 2/3. (3.136)

The sin θ = 0 root corresponds to the top and bottom of the hoop (θ = 0 and θ = π).
So we want the cos θ = 2/3 =⇒ θ ≈ ±48.2◦ root. The vertical acceleration is the
sum of the vertical components of at and ar, so

ay = at sin θ + ar cos θ = (g sin θ ) sin θ + 2g(1 − cos θ ) cos θ

= g(sin2θ + 2 cos θ − 2 cos2θ ).

(3.137)

(3.138)

Remark: The reason for this nice answer is the following. If there is no horizontal
acceleration, then the normal force from the hoop must have no horizontal component.
In other words, N sin θ = 0. Therefore, either sin θ = 0 (which gives the top and
bottom solutions of θ = 0 and θ = π), or N = 0, which means that there is no normal
force, so the bead feels only gravity, so it’s in freefall with ay = g.

3.8 Solutions

99

If we want, we can use this N = 0 requirement as the starting point for a second
solution. Using the ar from above, the radial F = ma equation is mg cos θ − N =
2mg(1 − cos θ), with positive N defined to point outward. Setting N = 0 gives the
desired result, cos θ = 2/3. ♣

3.22. Circling around a pole

and F sin θ = m ˙v.

because this integral diverges (barely, like a log) as t approaches T .

Chapter 4
Oscillations

In this chapter we will discuss oscillatory motion. The simplest examples of such
motion are a swinging pendulum and a mass on a spring, but it is possible to make
a system more complicated by introducing a damping force and/or an external
driving force. We will study all of these cases.

We are interested in oscillatory motion for two reasons. First, we study it
because we can study it. This is one of the few systems in physics where we can
solve the motion exactly. There’s nothing wrong with looking under the lamppost
every now and then. Second, oscillatory motion is ubiquitous in nature, for
reasons that will become clear in Section 5.2. If there was ever a type of physical
system worthy of study, this is it. We’ll start off by doing some necessary math
in Section 4.1. And then in Section 4.2 we’ll show how the math is applied to the
physics.

4.1 Linear differential equations

A linear differential equation is one in which x and its time derivatives enter only
through their first powers. An example is 3¨x + 7˙x + x = 0. An example of a
nonlinear differential equation is 3¨x + 7˙x2 + x = 0. If the right-hand side of the
equation is zero, then we use the term homogeneous differential equation. If the
right-hand side is some function of t, as in the case of 3¨x − 4˙x = 9t2 − 5, then
we use the term inhomogeneous differential equation. The goal of this chapter
is to learn how to solve linear differential equations, both homogeneous and
inhomogeneous. These come up again and again in physics, so we had better
find a systematic method of solving them.

The techniques that we will use are best learned through examples, so let’s
solve a few differential equations, starting with some simple ones. Throughout
this chapter, x is understood to be a function of t. Hence, a dot denotes time
differentiation.

Example 1 ( ˙x = ax): This is a very simple differential equation. There are two
ways (at least) to solve it.

101

102

Oscillations

First method: Separate variables to obtain dx/x = a dt, and then integrate to
obtain ln x = at + c, where c is a constant of integration. Then exponentiate to obtain

x = Aeat,

(4.1)

where A ≡ ec. A is determined by the value of x at, say, t = 0.

Second method: Guess an exponential solution, that is, one of the form x =
αt. Substitution into ˙x = ax immediately gives α = a. Therefore, the solution is
Ae
x = Aeat. Note that we can’t solve for A, due to the fact that our differential equation
is homogeneous and linear in x (translation: A cancels out). A is determined by the
initial condition.

This method may seem a bit silly, and somewhat cheap. But as we will see below,
guessing these exponential functions (or sums of them) is actually the most general
thing we can try, so the method is indeed quite general.

Remark: Using this method, you might be concerned that although we have found one
solution, we might have missed another one. But the general theory of differential equations
says that a first-order linear equation has only one independent solution (we’ll just accept
this fact here). So if we find one solution, then we know that we’ve found the whole
thing. ♣

Example 2 (¨x = ax):
If a is negative, then we’ll see that this equation describes
the oscillatory motion of, say, a spring. If a is positive, then it describes exponentially
growing or decaying motion. There are two ways (at least) to solve this equation.

First method: We can use the separation-of-variables method from Section 3.3
here, because our system is one in which the force depends only on the position x. But
this method is rather cumbersome, as you found if you did Problem 3.10 or Exercise
3.38. It will certainly work, but in the case where our equation is linear in x, there is
a much simpler method:

Second method: As in the first example above, we can guess a solution of the
form x(t) = Aeαt and then find out what α must be. Again, we can’t solve for A,
because it cancels out. Plugging Ae
a. We have therefore
found two solutions. The most general solution is an arbitrary linear combination of
these,

αt into ¨x = ax gives α = ±

x(t) = Ae

a t,

(4.2)

which you can quickly check does indeed work. A and B are determined by the initial
conditions. As in the first example above, you might be concerned that although
we have found two solutions to the equation, we might have missed others. But the
general theory of differential equations says that our second-order linear equation has
only two independent solutions. Therefore, having found two independent solutions,
we know that we’ve found them all.

Very Important Remark: The fact that the sum of two different solutions is again a solu-
tion to our equation is a monumentally important property of linear differential equations.

4.1 Linear differential equations

103

This property does not hold for nonlinear differential equations, for example ¨x2 = bx,
because the act of squaring after adding the two solutions produces a cross term which
destroys the equality, as you should check (see Problem 4.1). This property is called the
principle of superposition. That is, superposing two solutions yields another solution. In
other words, linearity leads to superposition. This fact makes theories that are governed by
linear equations much easier to deal with than those that are governed by nonlinear ones.
General Relativity, for example, is based on nonlinear equations, and solutions to most
General Relativity systems are extremely difficult to come by.

For equations with one main condition
(Those linear), you have permission
To take your solutions,
With firm resolutions,
And add them in superposition. ♣

Let’s say a little more about the solution in Eq. (4.2). If a is negative, then it is
helpful to define a ≡ −ω2, where ω is a real number. The solution then becomes
x(t) = Aeiωt + Be
−iωt. Using eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ, this can be written in terms of
trig functions, if desired. Various ways of writing the solution are:

−iωt,

x(t) = Aeiωt + Be
x(t) = C cos ωt + D sin ωt,
x(t) = E cos(ωt + φ1),
x(t) = F sin(ωt + φ2).

(4.3)

Depending on the specifics of a given system, one of the above forms will work better
than the others. The various constants in these expressions are related to each other.
For example, C = E cos φ1 and D = −E sin φ1, which follow from the cosine sum
formula. Note that there are two free parameters in each of the above expressions for
x(t). These parameters are determined by the initial conditions (say, the position and
velocity at t = 0). In contrast with these free parameters, the quantity ω is determined
by the particular physical system we’re dealing with. For example, we’ll see that for
a spring, ω =
k/m, where k is the spring constant. ω is independent of the initial
conditions.

(cid:4)

If a is positive, then let’s define a ≡ α2, where α is a real number. The solution in
θ = cosh θ + sinh θ, this can
Eq. (4.2) then becomes x(t) = Ae
be written in terms of hyperbolic trig functions, if desired. Various ways of writing
the solution are:

−αt. Using e

αt + Be

−αt,

x(t) = Ae

αt + Be
x(t) = C cosh αt + D sinh αt,
x(t) = E cosh(αt + φ1),
x(t) = F sinh(αt + φ2).

(4.4)

Again, the various constants are related to each other. If you are unfamiliar with the
hyperbolic trig functions, a few facts are listed in Appendix A.

104

Oscillations

Although the solution in Eq. (4.2) is completely correct for both signs of a, it’s
generally more illuminating to write the negative-a solutions in either the trig forms
or the e

±iωt exponential form where the i’s are explicit.

The usefulness of our method of guessing exponential solutions cannot be overem-
phasized. It may seem somewhat restrictive, but it works. The examples in the
remainder of this chapter should convince you of this.

This is our method, essential,
For equations we solve, differential.
It gets the job done,
And it’s even quite fun.
We just try a routine exponential.

Example 3 (¨x +2γ ˙x + ax = 0): This will be our last mathematical example, and
then we’ll start doing some physics. As we’ll see later, this example pertains to a
damped harmonic oscillator. We’ve put a factor of 2 in the coefficient of ˙x here to
make some later formulas look nicer. The force in this example (if we switch from
math to physics for a moment) is −2γ ˙x − ax (times m), which depends on both v
and x. Our methods of Section 3.3 therefore don’t apply; we’re not going to be able
to use separation of variables here. This leaves us with only our method of guessing
αt into
an exponential solution, Aeαt. So let’s see what it gives us. Plugging x(t) = Ae
the given equation, and canceling the nonzero factor of Ae

αt, gives

The solutions for α are −γ ±
solution to our equation is

α2 + 2γ α + a = 0.

If γ 2 − a < 0, then we can write this in terms of sines and cosines, so we have
−γ t factor (or it increases, if
oscillatory motion that decreases in time due to the e
γ < 0, but this is rarely physical). If γ 2 − a > 0, then we have exponential motion.
We’ll talk more about these different possibilities in Section 4.3.

In the first two examples above, the solutions were fairly clear. But in the present
case, you’re not apt to look at the above solution and say, “Oh, of course. It’s obvious!”
So our method of trying solutions of the form Ae

αt isn’t looking so silly anymore.

In general, if we have an nth order homogeneous linear differential equation,

then our strategy is to guess an exponential solution, x(t) = Aeαt, and to then (in
theory) solve the resulting nth order equation, αn + cn−1αn−1 + · · · + c1α + c0 =
0, for α, to obtain the solutions α1, . . . , αn. The general solution for x(t) is then
the superposition,

x(t) = A1e

(4.8)

where the Ai are determined by the initial conditions. In practice, however, we
will rarely encounter differential equations of degree higher than 2. (Note: if
some of the αi happen to be equal, then Eq. (4.8) is not valid, so a modification
is needed. We will encounter such a situation in Section 4.3.)

4.2 Simple harmonic motion

Let’s now do some real live physical problems. We’ll start with simple harmonic
motion. This is the motion undergone by a particle subject to a force F(x) = −kx.
The classic system that undergoes simple harmonic motion is a mass attached
to a massless spring, on a frictionless table (see Fig. 4.1). A typical spring has
a force of the form F(x) = −kx, where x is the displacement from equilibrium
(see Section 5.2 for the reason behind this). This is “Hooke’s law,” and it holds as
long as the spring isn’t stretched or compressed too far. Eventually this expression
breaks down for any real spring. But if we assume a −kx force, then F = ma
gives −kx = m¨x, or

¨x + ω2x = 0, where ω ≡

(cid:1)

k
m

.

(4.9)

This is simply the equation we studied in Example 2 in the previous section.
From Eq. (4.3), the solution may be written as

x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ).

(4.10)

This trig solution shows that the system oscillates back and forth forever in time.
ω is the angular frequency. If t increases by 2π/ω, then the argument of the
cosine increases by 2π, so the position and velocity are back to what they were.
The period (the time for one complete cycle) is therefore T = 2π/ω = 2π
m/k.
The frequency in cycles per second (hertz) is ν = 1/T = ω/2π. The constant
A (or rather the absolute value of A, if A is negative) is the amplitude, that is,
the maximum distance the mass gets from the origin. Note that the velocity as a
function of time is v(t) ≡ ˙x(t) = −Aω sin(ωt + φ).

(cid:4)

The constants A and φ are determined by the initial conditions. If, for example,
x(0) = 0 and ˙x(0) = v, then we must have A cos φ = 0 and −Aω sin φ = v.
Hence, φ = π/2, and so A = −v/ω (or φ = −π/2 and A = v/ω, but this
leads to the same solution). Therefore, we have x(t) = −(v/ω) cos(ωt + π/2).
This looks a little nicer if we write it as x(t) = (v/ω) sin(ωt). It turns out that

106

Oscillations

θ

m

Fig. 4.2

if the facts you’re given are the initial position and velocity, x0 and v0, then the
x(t) = C cos ωt + D sin ωt expression in Eq. (4.3) usually works best, because
(as you can verify) it yields the nice clean results, C = x0 and D = v0/ω.
Problem 4.3 gives another setup that involves initial conditions.

Example (Simple pendulum): Another classic system that undergoes (approx-
imately) simple harmonic motion is the simple pendulum, that is, a mass that hangs
on a massless string and swings in a vertical plane. Let (cid:2) be the length of the string,
and let θ (t) be the angle the string makes with the vertical (see Fig. 4.2). Then the
gravitational force on the mass in the tangential direction is −mg sin θ. So F = ma
in the tangential direction gives

−mg sin θ = m((cid:2) ¨θ).

(4.11)

The tension in the string combines with the radial component of gravity to produce the
radial acceleration, so the radial F = ma equation serves only to tell us the tension,
which we won’t need here.

We will now enter the realm of approximations and assume that the amplitude of
the oscillations is small. Without this approximation, the problem cannot be solved
in closed form. Assuming θ is small, we can use sin θ ≈ θ in Eq. (4.11) to obtain

Therefore,

¨θ + ω2θ = 0, where ω ≡

(cid:1)

g
(cid:2) .

θ(t) = A cos(ωt + φ),

(4.12)

(4.13)

√

where A and φ are determined by the initial conditions. So the pendulum undergoes
g/(cid:2). The period is therefore T =
simple harmonic motion with a frequency of
2π/ω = 2π
(cid:2)/g. The true motion is arbitrarily close to this, for sufficiently small
amplitudes. Exercise 4.23 deals with the higher-order corrections to the motion in the
case where the amplitude is not small.

√

There will be many occasions throughout your physics education where you
will plow through a calculation and then end up with a simple equation of the
form ¨z + ω2z = 0, where ω2 is a positive quantity that depends on various
parameters in the problem. When you encounter such an equation, you should
jump for joy, because without any more effort you can simply write down the
answer: the solution for z must be of the form z(t) = A cos(ωt + φ). No matter
how complicated the system looks at first glance, if you end up with an equation
that looks like ¨z + ω2z = 0, then you know that the system undergoes simple
harmonic motion with a frequency equal to the square root of the coefficient of z,
no matter what that coefficient is. If you end up with ¨z + (zucchini)z = 0, then
the frequency is ω =
zucchini (well, as long as the zucchini is positive and has
the dimensions of inverse time squared).

4.3 Damped harmonic motion

Consider a mass m attached to the end of a spring with spring constant k. Let
the mass be subject to a drag force proportional to its velocity, Ff = −bv (the
subscript f here stands for “friction”; we’ll save the letter d for “driving” in the
next section); see Fig. 4.3. Why do we study this Ff = −bv damping force? Two
reasons: First, it is linear in x, which will allow us to solve for the motion. And
second, it is a perfectly realistic force; an object moving at a slow speed through
a fluid generally experiences a drag force proportional to its velocity. Note that
this Ff = −bv force is not the force that a mass would feel if it were placed on
a table with friction. In that case the drag force would be (roughly) constant.

Our goal in this section is to solve for the position as a function of time. The

total force on the mass is F = −b˙x − kx. So F = m¨x gives

¨x + 2γ ˙x + ω2x = 0,

(4.14)

where 2γ ≡ b/m, and ω2 ≡ k/m. This is conveniently the same equation we
already solved in Example 3 in Section 4.1 (with a → ω2). Now, however, we
have the physical restrictions that γ > 0 and ω2 > 0. Letting (cid:18)2 ≡ γ 2 − ω2 for
simplicity, we may write the solution in Eq. (4.6) as

(cid:5)

x(t) = e

−γ t

(cid:18)t + Be

Ae

−(cid:18)t

(cid:6)

(cid:15)

, where (cid:18) ≡

γ 2 − ω2.

(4.15)

There are three cases to consider.

Case 1: Underdamping ((cid:3)2 < 0)

(cid:4)

If (cid:18)2 < 0, then γ < ω. Since (cid:18) is imaginary, let us define the real number
˜ω ≡

ω2 − γ 2, so that (cid:18) = i ˜ω. Equation (4.15) then gives

(cid:7)

x(t) = e

−γ t

Aei ˜ωt + Be

−i ˜ωt

(cid:8)

≡ e

−γ tC cos( ˜ωt + φ).

(4.16)

These two forms are equivalent. Using eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ, the constants in
Eq. (4.16) are related by A + B = C cos φ and A − B = iC sin φ. Note that in a
physical problem, x(t) is real, so we must have A∗ = B, where the star denotes
complex conjugation. The two constants A and B, or the two constants C and φ,
are determined by the initial conditions.

Depending on the given problem, one of the expressions in Eq. (4.16) will
inevitably work better than the other. Or perhaps one of the other forms in Eq. (4.3)
(times e−γ t) will be the most useful one. The cosine form makes it apparent that
the motion is harmonic motion whose amplitude decreases in time, due to the
e−γ t factor. A plot of such motion is shown in Fig. 4.4.1 The frequency of the

1 To be precise, the amplitude doesn’t decrease exactly like Ce

−γ t , as Eq. (4.16) suggests, because
−γ t describes the envelope of the motion, and not the curve that passes through the extremes of

ω2 − γ 2, is smaller than the natural frequency ω of the undamped

If γ is very small (more precisely, if γ (cid:4) ω), then ˜ω ≈ ω, which makes sense
Remarks:
because we almost have an undamped oscillator. If γ is very close to ω, then ˜ω ≈ 0. So the
oscillations are very slow (more precisely, ˜ω (cid:4) ω). Of course, for very small ˜ω it’s hard to even
tell that the oscillations exist, because they will damp out on a time scale of order 1/γ ≈ 1/ω,
which is short compared with the long time scale of the oscillations, 1/ ˜ω. ♣

Case 2: Overdamping ((cid:3)2 > 0)

If (cid:18)2 > 0, then γ > ω. (cid:18) is real (and taken to be positive), so Eq. (4.15) gives

x(t) = Ae

−(γ −(cid:18))t + Be

−(γ +(cid:18))t.

(4.17)

t

There is no oscillatory motion in this case; see Fig. 4.5. Since γ > (cid:18) ≡
(cid:4)
γ 2 − ω2, both of the exponents are negative, so the motion goes to zero for
large t. This had better be the case, because a real spring is certainly not going
to have the motion fly off to infinity. If we had obtained a positive exponent
somehow, we’d know we had made a mistake.

If γ is just slightly larger than ω, then (cid:18) ≈ 0, so the two terms in (4.17) are
Remarks:
roughly equal, and we essentially have exponential decay, according to e−γ t. If γ (cid:6) ω
(that is, strong damping), then (cid:18) ≈ γ , so the first term in (4.17) dominates (it has the less
negative exponent), and we essentially have exponential decay according to e−(γ −(cid:18))t. We can
be somewhat quantitative about this by approximating (cid:18) as

(cid:15)

(cid:15)

(cid:18) ≡

γ 2 − ω2 = γ

1 − ω2/γ 2 ≈ γ (1 − ω2/2γ 2).

(4.18)

Hence, the exponential behavior goes like e−ω2t/2γ . Because γ (cid:6) ω, this is slow decay (that
is, slow compared with t ∼ 1/ω), which makes sense if the damping is very strong. The mass
slowly creeps back to the origin, as in the case of a weak spring immersed in molasses. ♣

Case 3: Critical damping ((cid:3)2 = 0)

If (cid:18)2 = 0, then γ = ω. Equation (4.14) therefore becomes ¨x + 2γ ˙x + γ 2x = 0.
In this special case, we have to be careful in solving our differential equation. The
solution in Eq. (4.15) is not valid, because in the procedure leading to Eq. (4.6),
the roots α1 and α2 are equal (to −γ ), so we have really found only one solution,
e−γ t. We’ll just invoke here the result from the theory of differential equations
that says that in this special case, the other solution is of the form te−γ t.

Remark: You should check explicitly that te−γ t solves the equation ¨x + 2γ ˙x + γ 2x = 0. Or if
you want to, you can derive it in the spirit of Problem 4.2. In the more general case where there
are n identical roots in the procedure leading to Eq. (4.8) (call them all α), the n independent
solutions to the differential equation are tk eαt, for 0 ≤ k ≤ (n − 1). But more often than not,
there are no repeated roots, so you don’t have to worry about this. ♣

−1(γ / ˜ω)). This
the motion. You can show that the amplitude in fact decreases like Ce

damping (γ (cid:4) ω), this is essentially equal to Ce

x(t)

e-γt (A+Bt)

t

Fig. 4.6

The exponential factor eventually wins out over the Bt term, so the motion goes
to zero for large t (see Fig. 4.6).

If we are given a spring with a fixed ω, and if we look at the system for
different values of γ , then critical damping (when γ = ω) is the case where
the motion converges to zero in the quickest way (which is like e−ωt). This is
true because in the underdamped case (γ < ω), the envelope of the oscillatory
motion goes like e−γ t, which goes to zero slower than e−ωt, because γ < ω.
And in the overdamped case (γ > ω), the dominant piece is the e−(γ −(cid:18))t term.
And as you can verify, if γ > ω then γ − (cid:18) ≡ γ −
γ 2 − ω2 < ω, so this
motion also goes to zero slower than e−ωt. Critical damping is very important in
many real systems, such as screen doors and shock absorbers, where the goal is
to have the system head to zero (without overshooting and bouncing around) as
fast as possible.

4.4 Driven (and damped) harmonic motion

Before we examine driven harmonic motion, we must learn how to solve a new
type of differential equation. How can we solve something of the form

¨x + 2γ ˙x + ax = C0eiω0t,

(4.20)

where γ , a, ω0, and C0 are given quantities? This is an inhomogeneous differential
equation, due to the term on the right-hand side. It’s not very physical, because
the right-hand side is complex, but let’s not worry about that for now. Equations
of this sort come up again and again, and fortunately there’s a straightforward
(although sometimes messy) method for solving them. As usual, the method
involves making a reasonable guess, plugging it in, and seeing what condition
comes out. Since we have the eiω0t sitting on the right-hand side of Eq. (4.20),
let’s guess a solution of the form x(t) = Aeiω0t. A will depend on ω0, among
other things, as we will see. Plugging this guess into Eq. (4.20) and canceling the
nonzero factor of eiω0t, we obtain

(−ω2
0

)A + 2γ (iω0)A + aA = C0.

Solving for A, we find that our solution for x is

x(t) =

eiω0t.

(4.21)

(4.22)

Note the differences between this technique and the one in Example 3 in
Section 4.1. In that example, the goal was to determine the α in x(t) = Aeαt.

110

Oscillations

And there was no way to solve for A; the initial conditions determined A. But in
the present technique, the ω0 in x(t) = Aeiω0t is a given quantity, and the goal
is to solve for A in terms of the given constants. Therefore, in the solution in
Eq. (4.22), there are no free constants to be determined by the initial conditions.
We’ve found one particular solution, and we’re stuck with it. The term particular
solution is used for Eq. (4.22).

With no freedom to adjust the solution in Eq. (4.22), how can we satisfy an
arbitrary set of initial conditions? Fortunately, Eq. (4.22) does not represent the
most general solution to Eq. (4.20). The most general solution is the sum of
our particular solution in Eq. (4.22), plus the “homogeneous” solution we found
in Eq. (4.6). This sum is certainly a solution, because the solution in Eq. (4.6)
was explicitly constructed to yield zero when plugged into the left-hand side of
Eq. (4.20). Therefore, tacking it on to our particular solution doesn’t change the
equality in Eq. (4.20), because the left side is linear. The principle of superposition
has saved the day. The complete solution to Eq. (4.20) is therefore

where A and B are determined by the initial conditions.

With superposition in mind, it’s clear what the strategy should be if we have

a slightly more general equation to solve, for example,

¨x + 2γ ˙x + ax = C1eiω1t + C2eiω2t.

(4.24)

Simply solve the equation with only the first term on the right. Then solve the
equation with only the second term on the right. Then add the two solutions. And
then add on the homogeneous solution from Eq. (4.6). We are able to apply the
principle of superposition because the left-hand side of Eq. (4.24) is linear.

Finally, let’s look at the case where we have many such terms on the right-hand

side, for example,

¨x + 2γ ˙x + ax =

N(cid:19)

n=1

Cneiωnt.

(4.25)

We need to solve N different equations, each with only one of the N terms on
the right-hand side. Then we add up all the solutions, and then we add on the
homogeneous solution from Eq. (4.6). If N is infinite, that’s fine; we just have
to add up an infinite number of solutions. This is the principle of superposition
at its best.

Remark: The previous paragraph, combined with a basic result from Fourier analysis, allows
us to solve (in principle) any equation of the form

¨x + 2γ ˙x + ax = f (t).

(4.26)

4.4 Driven (and damped) harmonic motion

Fourier analysis says that any (nice enough) function f (t) can be decomposed into its Fourier
components,

f (t) =

(cid:14) ∞

−∞

g(ω)eiωtdω.

(4.27)

In this continuous sum, the functions g(ω) (times dω) take the place of the coefficients Cn in
Eq. (4.25). So if Sω(t) is the solution for x(t) when there is only the term eiωt on the right-hand
side of Eq. (4.26) (that is, Sω(t) is the solution given in Eq. (4.22), without the C0 factor), then
the principle of superposition tells us that the complete particular solution to Eq. (4.26) is

x(t) =

(cid:14) ∞

−∞

g(ω)Sω(t) dω.

(4.28)

Finding the coefficients g(ω) is the hard part (or rather, the messy part), but we won’t get into
that here. We won’t do anything with Fourier analysis in this book, but it’s nevertheless good
to know that it is possible to solve (4.26) for any function f (t). Most of the functions we’ll
consider will be nice functions like cos ω0t, which has a very simple Fourier decomposition,
namely cos ω0t = 1

(eiω0t + e−iω0t). ♣

Let’s now do a physical example.

Example (Damped and driven spring): Consider a spring with spring constant
k. A mass m at the end of the spring is subject to a drag force proportional to its
velocity, Ff = −bv. The mass is also subject to a driving force, Fd(t) = Fd cos ωdt
(see Fig. 4.7). What is its position as a function of time?

Solution: The force on the mass is F(x, ˙x, t) = −b˙x−kx+Fd cos ωdt. So F = ma
gives

where 2γ ≡ b/m, ω2 ≡ k/m, and F ≡ Fd/m. Note that there are two different
frequencies here, ω and ωd, which need not have anything to do with each other.
Equation (4.22), along with the principle of superposition, tells us that our particular

The complete solution is the sum of this particular solution and the homogeneous

because x must be real), and write x in terms of sines and cosines. Getting the i’s
out of the denominators (by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by
the complex conjugate of the denominator), and using eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ, we find,

Remarks:
If you want, you can solve Eq. (4.29) by taking the real part of the solution to
Eq. (4.20) (with C0 → F), that is, the x(t) in Eq. (4.22). This is true because if we take
the real part of Eq. (4.20), we obtain

C0eiω0t

(4.32)

In other words, if x satisfies Eq. (4.20) with a C0eiω0t on the right-hand side, then Re(x)
satisfies it with a C0 cos(ω0t) on the right. At any rate, it’s clear that the real part of the
solution in Eq. (4.22) (with C0 → F) does indeed give the result in Eq. (4.31), because
in Eq. (4.30) we simply took half of a quantity plus its complex conjugate, which is the
real part.

If you don’t like using complex numbers, another way of solving Eq. (4.29) is to keep it in
the form with the cos ωdt on the right, and guess a solution of the form A cos ωdt+B sin ωdt,
and then solve for A and B (this is the task of Problem 4.8). The result is Eq. (4.31). ♣

We can now write Eq. (4.31) in a very simple form. If we define

The constants A and B are determined by the initial conditions. If there is any damping
at all in the system (that is, if γ > 0), then the homogeneous part of the solution
goes to zero for large t, and we are left with only the particular solution. In other
words, the system approaches a definite x(t), namely xp(t), independent of the initial
conditions.

(cid:4)

ω2 − ω2
d
Given ωd and γ , this is maximum when ω = ωd. Given ω and γ , it is maximum
when ωd =
ω2 − 2γ 2, as you can show in Exercise 4.29. But for weak damping
(that is, γ (cid:4) ω, which is usually the case we are concerned with), this reduces
to ωd ≈ ω also. The term resonance is used to describe the situation where the
amplitude of the oscillations is as large as possible. It is quite reasonable that
this is achieved when the driving frequency equals the frequency of the spring.
But what is the value of the phase φ at resonance? Using Eq. (4.35), we see that
φ satisfies tan φ ≈ ±∞ when ωd ≈ ω. Therefore, φ = π/2 (it is indeed π/2,
and not −π/2, because the sin φ in Eq. (4.35) is positive), and the motion of the
particle lags the driving force by a quarter of a cycle at resonance. For example,
when the particle moves rightward past the origin (which means it has a quarter
of a cycle to go before it hits the maximum value of x), the force is already at its
maximum. And when the particle makes it out to the maximum value of x, the
force is already back to zero.

The fact that the force is maximum when the particle is moving fastest makes
sense from an energy point of view.2 If you want the amplitude to become large,
then you need to give the system as much energy as you can. That is, you must
do as much work as possible on the system. And in order to do as much work
as possible, you should have your force act over as large a distance as possible,
which means that you should apply your force when the particle is moving fastest,
that is, as it speeds past the origin. And similarly, you don’t want to waste your
force when the particle is barely moving near the endpoints of its motion. In short,
v is the derivative of x and therefore a quarter cycle ahead of x (which is a general
property of a sinusoidal function, as you can show). Since we want the force to
be in phase with v at resonance (by the above energy argument), we see that the
force is also a quarter cycle ahead of x.

Resonance has a large number of extremely important applications (both
wanted and unwanted) in the real world. On the desirable side, resonance makes

it possible to have a relaxing day at the beach at the Bay of Fundy, talking to
a friend over your cell phone while pushing a child on a swing at low tide. On
the undesirable side, your ride home on that newly discovered “washboard” dirt
road will be annoyingly bumpy at a certain speed, and any attempt to take your
mind off the discomfort by turning up the radio will result only in certain parts
of your car rattling in perfect sync (well, actually 90◦ out of phase) with the bass
line of your formerly favorite song.3

The phase φ
Equation (4.35) gives the phase of the motion as
tan φ = 2γ ωd
ω2 − ω2
d

,

(4.38)

where 0 ≤ φ ≤ π. Let’s look at a few cases for ωd (not necessarily at resonance)
and see what the resulting phase φ is. Using Eq. (4.38), we have:

• If ωd ≈ 0 (or more precisely, if γ ωd (cid:4) ω2 − ω2

d), then φ ≈ 0. This means that the
motion is in phase with the force. The mathematical reason for this is that if ωd ≈ 0,
then both ¨x and ˙x are small, because they are proportional to ω2
d and ωd, respectively.
Therefore, the first two terms in Eq. (4.29) are negligible, so we end up with x ∝ cos ωdt.
In other words, the phase is zero.

The physical reason is that since there is essentially no acceleration, the net force is
always essentially zero. This means that the driving force always essentially balances
◦
the spring force (that is, the two forces are 180
out of phase), because the damping
◦
force is negligible (since ˙x ∝ ωd ≈ 0). But the spring force is 180
out of phase with
the motion (because of the minus sign in F = −kx). Therefore, the driving force is in
phase with the motion.

• If ωd ≈ ω, then φ ≈ π/2. This is the case of resonance, discussed above.
• If ωd ≈ ∞ (or more precisely, if γ ωd (cid:4) ω2
d

− ω2), then φ ≈ π. The mathematical
reason for this is that if ωd ≈ ∞, then the ¨x term in Eq. (4.29) dominates, so we have
¨x ∝ cos ωdt. Therefore, ¨x is in phase with the force. But x is 180
out of phase with
◦
¨x (this is a general property of a sinusoidal function), so x is 180
out of phase with
the force.

◦

The physical reason is that if ωd ≈ ∞, then the mass hardly moves, because from
Eq. (4.37) we see that the amplitude is proportional to 1/ω2
d. This amplitude then implies
that the velocity is proportional to 1/ωd. Therefore, both x and v are always small. But
if x and v are always small, then the spring and damping forces can be ignored. So
we basically have a mass that feels only one force, the driving force. But we already
understand very well a situation where a mass is subject to only one oscillating force:
a mass on a spring. The mass in our setup can’t tell if it’s being driven by an oscillating

3 Some other examples of resonance that are often cited are in fact not actually examples of resonance,
but rather of “negative damping” (also known as positive feedback). Musical instruments fall into
this category, as does the well-known Tacoma Narrows bridge failure. For a detailed discussion of
this issue, see Billah and Scanlan (1991) and also Green and Unruh (2006).

4.5 Coupled oscillators

driving force, or being pushed and pulled by an oscillating spring force. They both feel
the same. Therefore, both phases must be the same. But in the spring case, the minus
◦
sign in F = −kx tells us that the force is 180
out of phase with the motion. Hence, the
same result holds in the ωd ≈ ∞ case.
Another special case for the phase occurs when γ = 0 (no damping), for
which we have tan φ = ±0, depending on the sign of ω2 − ω2
d. So φ is either
0 or π. The motion is therefore either exactly in phase or out of phase with the
driving force, depending on which of ω or ωd is larger.

4.5 Coupled oscillators
In the previous sections, we dealt with only one function of time, x(t). What if
we have two functions of time, say x(t) and y(t), that are related by a pair of
“coupled” differential equations? For example, we might have

2¨x + ω2(5x − 3y) = 0,

2¨y + ω2(5y − 3x) = 0.

(4.39)

For now, let’s not worry about how these equations might arise. Let’s just try
to solve them (we’ll do a physical example later in this section). We’ll assume
ω2 > 0 here, although this isn’t necessary. We’ll also assume there aren’t any
damping or driving forces, although a few of the problems and exercises for this
chapter deal with these additions. We call the above equations “coupled” because
there are x’s and y’s in both of them, and it isn’t immediately obvious how to
separate them to solve for x and y. There are two methods (at least) for solving
these equations.

First method: Sometimes it is easy, as in this case, to find certain linear combi-
nations of the given equations for which nice things happen. If we take the sum,
we find

(¨x + ¨y) + ω2(x + y) = 0.

(4.40)

This equation involves x and y only in the combination of their sum, x + y. With
z ≡ x + y, Eq. (4.40) is just our old friend, ¨z + ω2z = 0. The solution is

x + y = A1 cos(ωt + φ1),

(4.41)

where A1 and φ1 are determined by the initial conditions. We may also take the
difference of Eqs. (4.39), which results in

(¨x − ¨y) + 4ω2(x − y) = 0.

(4.42)

This equation involves x and y only in the combination of their difference, x − y.
The solution is

x − y = A2 cos(2ωt + φ2).

(4.43)

116

Oscillations

Taking the sum and difference of Eqs. (4.41) and (4.43), we find that x(t) and
y(t) are given by

x(t) = B1 cos(ωt + φ1) + B2 cos(2ωt + φ2),
y(t) = B1 cos(ωt + φ1) − B2 cos(2ωt + φ2),

(4.44)

where the Bi’s are half of the Ai’s. The strategy of this solution was simply
to fiddle around and try to form differential equations that involved only one
combination of the variables. This allowed us to write down the familiar solution
for these combinations, as we did in Eqs. (4.41) and (4.43).

We’ve managed to solve our equations for x and y. However, it turns out that
the more interesting thing we’ve done is produce the equations (4.41) and (4.43).
The combinations (x + y) and (x − y) are called the normal coordinates of the
system. These are the combinations that oscillate with one pure frequency. The
motion of x and y will in general look complicated, and it may be difficult to tell
that the motion is really made up of just the two frequencies in Eq. (4.44). But
if you plot the values of (x + y) and (x − y) as time goes by, for any motion of
the system, then you will find nice sinusoidal graphs, even if x and y are each
behaving in a rather unpleasant manner.

In the above method, it was fairly easy to guess which combi-
Second method:
nations of Eqs. (4.39) would produce equations involving only one combination
of x and y. But surely there are problems in physics where the guessing isn’t so
easy. What do we do then? Fortunately, there is a fail-safe method for solving for
x and y. It proceeds as follows.

In the spirit of Section 4.1, let’s try a solution of the form x = Aeiαt and

y = Beiαt, which we will write, for convenience, as

(cid:2)

x
y

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

eiαt.

(4.45)

It isn’t obvious that there should exist solutions for x and y that have the same t
dependence, but let’s try it and see what happens. We’ve explicitly put the i in
the exponent, but there’s no loss of generality here. If α happens to be imaginary,
then the exponent is real. It’s personal preference whether or not you put the i in.
Plugging our guess into Eqs. (4.39), and dividing through by eiωt, we find

2A(−α2) + 5Aω2 − 3Bω2 = 0,

2B(−α2) + 5Bω2 − 3Aω2 = 0,

or equivalently, in matrix form,

This homogeneous equation for A and B has a nontrivial solution (that is, one
where A and B aren’t both 0) only if the matrix is not invertible. This is true
because if it were invertible, then we could multiply through by the inverse to
obtain (A, B) = (0, 0). When is a matrix invertible? There is a straightforward
(although tedious) method for finding the inverse. It involves taking cofactors,
taking a transpose, and dividing by the determinant. The step that concerns
us here is the division by the determinant, since this implies that the inverse
exists if and only if the determinant is not zero. So we see that Eq. (4.47) has
a nontrivial solution only if the determinant equals zero. Because we seek a
nontrivial solution, we must therefore have

This is a quadratic equation in α2, and the roots are α = ±ω and α = ±2ω.
We have therefore found four types of solutions. If α = ±ω, then we can plug
this back into Eq. (4.47) to obtain A = B. (Both equations give this same result.
This was essentially the point of setting the determinant equal to zero.) And if
α = ±2ω, then Eq. (4.47) gives A = −B. (Again, the equations are redundant.)
Note that we cannot solve specifically for A and B, but only for their ratio. Adding
up our four solutions according to the principle of superposition, we see that x
and y take the general form (written in vector form for the sake of simplicity and
bookkeeping),

The four Ai are determined by the initial conditions. We can rewrite Eq. (4.49)
in a somewhat cleaner form. If the coordinates x and y describe the positions of
particles, they must be real. Therefore, A1 and A2 must be complex conjugates,
and likewise for A3 and A4. If we then define some φ’s and B’s via A∗

where the Bi and φi are real (and are determined by the initial conditions). We
have therefore reproduced the result in Eq. (4.44).

It is clear from Eq. (4.50) that the combinations x + y and x − y (the normal
coordinates) oscillate with the pure frequencies, ω and 2ω, respectively, because

the combination x + y makes the B2 terms disappear, and the combination x − y
makes the B1 terms disappear.

It is also clear that if B2 = 0, then x = y at all times, and they both oscillate
with frequency ω. And if B1 = 0, then x = −y at all times, and they both
oscillate with frequency 2ω. These two pure-frequency motions are called the
normal modes. They are labeled by the vectors (1, 1) and (1, −1), respectively.
In describing a normal mode, both the vector and the frequency should be stated.
The significance of normal modes will become clear in the following example.

each other and to two walls by three springs, as shown in Fig. 4.9. The three springs
have the same spring constant k. Find the most general solution for the positions
of the masses as functions of time. What are the normal coordinates? What are the
normal modes?

Solution: Let x1(t) and x2(t) be the positions of the left and right masses, respec-
tively, relative to their equilibrium positions. Then the middle spring is stretched
a distance x2 − x1 compared with the stretch at equilibrium. Therefore, the net
force on the left mass is −kx1 + k(x2 − x1), and the net force on the right mass
is −kx2 − k(x2 − x1). It’s easy to make a mistake in the sign of the second term
in these expressions, but you can check it by, say, looking at the force when x2 is
very big. At any rate, the second term must have the opposite sign in the two expres-
sions, by Newton’s third law. With these forces, F = ma on each mass gives, with
ω2 = k/m,

¨x1 + 2ω2x1 − ω2x2 = 0,
¨x2 + 2ω2x2 − ω2x1 = 0.

(4.51)

These are rather friendly looking coupled equations, and we can see that the sum and
difference are the useful combinations to take. The sum gives

and the difference gives

(¨x1 + ¨x2) + ω2(x1 + x2) = 0,

(¨x1 − ¨x2) + 3ω2(x1 − x2) = 0.

The solutions to these equations are the normal coordinates,

x1 + x2 = A+ cos(ωt + φ+),
x1 − x2 = A− cos(

3ωt + φ−).

Taking the sum and difference of these normal coordinates, we have

x1(t) = B+ cos(ωt + φ+) + B− cos(

where the B’s are half of the A’s. Along with the φ’s, they are determined by the initial
conditions.

Remark: For practice, let’s also derive Eq. (4.55) by using the determinant method.
Letting x1 = Aeiαt and x2 = Beiαt in Eq. (4.51), we see that for there to be a nontrivial
solution for A and B, we must have

is equivalent to Eq. (4.55). ♣

The normal modes are obtained by setting either B− or B+ equal to zero in Eq. (4.55)
or Eq. (4.57). Therefore, the normal modes are (1, 1) and (1, −1). How do we visualize
these? The mode (1, 1) oscillates with frequency ω. In this case (where B− = 0), we
have x1(t) = x2(t) = B+ cos(ωt + φ+) at all times. So the masses simply oscillate
back and forth in the same manner, as shown in Fig. 4.10. It is clear that such motion
has frequency ω, because as far as the masses are concerned, the middle spring is
effectively not there, so each mass moves under the influence of only one spring, and
therefore has frequency ω.

√

The mode (1, −1) oscillates with frequency

3ω. In this case (where B+ = 0),
we have x1(t) = −x2(t) = B− cos(
3ωt + φ−) at all times. So the masses oscillate
back and forth with opposite displacements, as shown in Fig. 4.11. It is clear that this
mode should have a frequency larger than that for the other mode, because the middle
spring is stretched (or compressed), so the masses feel a larger force. But it takes a
little thought to show that the frequency is

3ω. 4

√

√

Fig. 4.10

The normal mode (1, 1) above is associated with the normal coordinate x1 +x2.
They both involve the frequency ω. However, this association is not due to the
fact that the coefficients of both x1 and x2 in this normal coordinate are equal to 1.

Fig. 4.11

√

4 If you want to obtain this

3ω result without going through all of the above work, just note that
the center of the middle spring doesn’t move. Therefore, it acts like two “half springs,” each with
spring constant 2k (as you can verify). Hence, each mass is effectively attached to a “k” spring and
a “2k” spring, yielding a total effective spring constant of 3k. Thus the

Rather, it is due to the fact that the other normal mode, namely (x1, x2) ∝ (1, −1),
gives no contribution to the sum x1 + x2. There are a few too many 1’s floating
around in the above example, so it’s hard to see which results are meaningful and
which results are coincidence. But the following example should clear things up.
Let’s say we solved a problem using the determinant method, and we found the
solution to be

(4.58)

Then 5x + y is the normal coordinate associated with the normal mode (3, 2),
which has frequency ω1. (This is true because there is no cos(ω2t + φ2) depen-
dence in the combination 5x + y.) And similarly, 2x − 3y is the normal coordinate
associated with the normal mode (1, −5), which has frequency ω2 (because there
is no cos(ω1t + φ1) dependence in the combination 2x − 3y).

Note the difference between the types of differential equations we solved in
the previous chapter in Section 3.3, and the types we solved throughout this
chapter. The former dealt with forces that did not have to be linear in x or ˙x, but
that had to depend on only x, or only ˙x, or only t. The latter dealt with forces
that could depend on all three of these quantities, but that had to be linear in
x and ˙x.

Two springs each have spring constant k and equilibrium length (cid:2). They

In the strong damping (γ (cid:6) ω) case discussed in the remark in the
overdamping subsection, we saw that x(t) ∝ e−ω2t/2γ for large t. Using
the definitions of ω and γ , this can be written as x(t) ∝ e−kt/b, where b
is the coefficient of the damping force. By looking at the forces on the
mass, explain why this makes sense.

A critically damped oscillator with natural frequency ω starts out at
position x0 > 0. What is the maximum initial speed (directed toward
the origin) it can have and not cross the origin?

An overdamped oscillator with natural frequency ω and damping coeffi-
cient γ starts out at position x0 > 0. What is the maximum initial speed

4.28. Ratio of maxima **

A mass on the end of a spring is released from rest at position x0. The
experiment is repeated, but now with the system immersed in a fluid
that causes the motion to be critically damped. Show that the maximum
speed of the mass in the first case is e times the maximum speed in the
second case.7

0 .

But be careful, this fourth-order correction comes from two terms.

7 The fact that the maximum speeds differ by a fixed numerical factor follows from dimensional
analysis, which tells us that the maximum speed in the first case must be proportional to ωx0. And

a fluid so that both masses feel a damping force, Ff = −bv. Solve for
x1(t) and x2(t). Assume underdamping.

The system in the example in Section 4.5 is modified by subjecting the
left mass to a driving force Fd cos(2ωt), and the right mass to a driving

maximum speed has no choice but to again be proportional to ωx0. But showing that the maximum
speeds differ by the nice factor of e requires a calculation.

The expression “a → 0” is sloppy because a has units of inverse time squared, and the
number 0 has no units. The proper statement is that Eq. (4.2) reduces to x(t) = C + Dt
a, which is now a comparison of
when
quantities with the same units. The smaller a is, the larger t can be. Therefore, if
a t (cid:4) 1, we can write

C is the initial position, and D is the speed of the particle. If these quantities are of

roughly negatives of each other, and both of order 1/
a. So if the speed and initial
position are of order 1, then A and B actually diverge in the “a → 0” limit. If a is small
a t (cid:4) 1 won’t hold,
but nonzero, then t will eventually become large enough so that
in which case the linear form in Eq. (4.63) won’t be valid.

4.3. Increasing the mass

The first thing we must do is find the velocity of the mass right before the collision. The
k/m. The
motion before the collision looks like x(t) = d cos(ωt + φ), where ω =
collision happens at t = 0 (although it actually doesn’t matter what time we plug in
here), so we have d/2 = x(0) = d cos φ, which gives φ = ±π/3. The velocity right
before the collision is therefore

(cid:4)

v(0) ≡ ˙x(0) = −ωd sin φ = −ωd sin(±π/3) = ∓(

3/2)ωd.

(4.64)

√

We want the plus sign, because we are told that the mass is moving to the right. Finding
the motion after the collision is now reduced to an initial conditions problem. We have
a mass 2m on a spring with spring constant k, with initial position d/2 and initial
3/4)ωd (half of the result above). In situations where we know the initial
velocity (
position and velocity, it turns out that the best form to use for x(t) from the expressions
in Eq. (4.3) is

√

x(t) = C cos ω(cid:16)

because the initial position at t = 0 is simply C, and the initial velocity at t = 0
is ω(cid:16)D. The initial conditions are therefore easy to apply. We have put a prime on
the frequency in Eq. (4.65) to remind us that it is different from the initial frequency,
because the mass is now 2m. So we have ω(cid:16) =
2. The initial conditions
therefore give

This is smaller than the original amplitude d, because energy is lost to heat during the
collision (but energy is one of the topics of the next chapter).

4.4. Average tension

Let the length of the pendulum be (cid:2). We know that the angle θ depends on time
according to

θ (t) = A cos(ωt),

(4.69)

√

where ω =
T − mg cos θ = m(cid:2) ˙θ 2. Using Eq. (4.69), this becomes

g/(cid:2). If T is the tension in the string, then the radial F = ma equation is

T = mg cos

over one period is 1/2 (you can show this by doing the integrals, or you can just note
that the averages are equal and they add up to 1), so the average value of T is

Tavg = mg + mgA2
4

,

(4.72)

which is larger than mg, by mgA2/4. It makes sense that Tavg > mg, because the
average value of the vertical component of T equals mg (because the pendulum has
no net rise or fall over a long period of time), and there is some nonzero contribution
to the magnitude of T from the horizontal component.

4.5. Walking east on a turntable

The velocity of the person with respect to the ground is the sum of v ˆx and u, where
u is the velocity (at the person’s position) of the turntable with respect to the ground.

4.8 Solutions

129

In terms of the angle θ in Fig. 4.28, the velocity components with respect to the ground
are

˙x = v − u sin θ,

and

˙y = u cos θ .

But u = rω. So we have, using r sin θ = y and r cos θ = x,

˙x = v − ωy,

and

˙y = ωx.

(4.73)

(4.74)

Taking the derivative of the first equation, and then plugging in ˙y from the second,
gives ¨x = −ω2x. Therefore, x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ). The first equation then quickly
gives y(t), and the result is that the general expression for the person’s position is

Fig. 4.28

Remarks:
It turns out that in the frame of the turntable, the person’s path is also a
circle. This can be seen in the following way. Imagine a distant object (say, a star)
located in the eastward direction. In the frame of the turntable, this star rotates clock-
wise with frequency ω. And in the frame of the turntable, the person’s velocity always
points toward the star. Therefore, the person’s velocity rotates clockwise with fre-
quency ω. And since the magnitude of the velocity is constant, this means that the
person travels clockwise in a circle in the frame of the turntable. From the usual
expression v = rω, we see that this circle has a radius v/ω.

This result leads to another way of showing that the person’s path is a circle as
viewed in the ground frame. In short, when the person’s clockwise circular motion at
speed v with respect to the turntable is combined with the counterclockwise motion of
the turntable with respect to the ground (with the same frequency ω, but in the opposite
direction), the resulting motion of the person with respect to the ground is a circle with
its center at the point (0, v/ω).

The situation is summarized in Fig. 4.29. From the above result (that the path
is a circle in the turntable frame), we may characterize the person’s motion in the
turntable frame by imagining her riding on a merry-go-round that rotates clockwise
with frequency ω with respect to the turntable. This merry-go-round is shown at five
different times in the figure. The effect of the merry-go-round’s clockwise rotational
motion is to cancel the counterclockwise rotation of the turntable, so that the merry-
go-round ends up not rotating at all with respect to the ground. Therefore, if the person
(the dot in the figure) starts at the top of the merry-go-round (which she in fact does,
because this corresponds to walking eastward with respect to the turntable), then she
always remains at the top. She therefore travels in a circle that is simply shifted upward
by the vertical radius of the merry-go-round (the dotted lines shown, which have length
v/ω), relative to the center of the turntable. This agrees with the original result. You
can also see from the figure how the values of A and φ in Eq. (4.76) arise. For example,
A is the length of the solid lines shown. ♣

4.6. Maximum speed

For the undamped case, the general form of x is x(t) = C cos(ωt + φ). The initial
condition v(0) = 0 tells us that φ = 0, and then the initial condition x(0) = x0 tells
us that C = x0. Therefore, x(t) = x0 cos(ωt), and so v(t) = −ωx0 sin(ωt). This has a
maximum magnitude of ωx0.

Now consider the overdamped case. Equation (4.17) gives the position as

x(t) = Ae

that in these two limits, tmax equals ln(2γ /ω)/γ and 1/γ ≈ 1/ω, respectively.

4.7. Exponential force

F = ma gives ¨x = a0e−bt. Let’s guess a particular solution of the form x(t) = Ce−bt.

x(t) = a0e−bt

4.9. Unequal masses

Let x1 and x2 be the positions of the left and right masses, respectively, relative to
their equilibrium positions. The forces on the two masses are −kx1 + k(x2 − x1) and
−kx2 − k(x2 − x1), respectively, so the F = ma equations are

¨x1 + 2ω2x1 − ω2x2 = 0,
2¨x2 + 2ω2x2 − ω2x1 = 0.

(4.91)

The appropriate linear combinations of these equations aren’t obvious, so we’ll use
the determinant method. Letting x1 = A1eiαt and x2 = A2eiαt, we see that for there to
be a nontrivial solution for A and B, we must have

4.10. Weakly coupled

The magnitude of the force in the middle spring is κ(x2 − x1), so the F = ma equations
are

m¨x1 = −kx1 + κ(x2 − x1),
m¨x2 = −kx2 − κ(x2 − x1).

Adding and subtracting these equations gives

m(¨x1 + ¨x2) = −k(x1 + x2) =⇒ x1 + x2 = A cos(ωt + φ),
m(¨x1 − ¨x2) = −(k + 2κ)(x1 − x2) =⇒ x1 − x2 = B cos( ˜ωt + ˜φ),

way to apply these is to plug them into the normal coordinates in Eq. (4.96), before
solving for x1(t) and x2(t). The velocity conditions quickly give φ = ˜φ = 0, and then

as desired. To get an idea of what this motion looks like, let’s examine x1. Since (cid:9) (cid:4) ω,
the cos((cid:9)t) oscillation is much slower than the cos((ω + (cid:9))t) oscillation. Therefore,
cos((cid:9)t) is essentially constant on the time scale of the cos((ω + (cid:9))t) oscillations. This
means that for the time span of a few of these oscillations, x1 essentially oscillates with
frequency ω + (cid:9) ≈ ω and amplitude a cos((cid:9)t). This a cos((cid:9)t) term is the “envelope”
of the oscillation, as shown in Fig. 4.30, for (cid:9)/ω = 1/10. Initially, the amplitude of
x1 is a, but it decreases to zero when (cid:9)t = π/2. By this time, the amplitude of the x2

oscillation, which is a sin((cid:9)t), has grown to a. So at t = π/2(cid:9), the right mass has all
the motion, and the left mass is at rest. This process keeps repeating. After each time
period of π/2(cid:9), the motion of one mass gets transferred to the other. The weaker the
coupling (that is, the spring constant κ) between the masses, the smaller the (cid:9), and so
the longer the time period.

Remarks: The above reasoning also holds for two pendulums connected by a weak
spring. All the above steps carry through, with the only change being that k is replaced
by mg/(cid:2), because the spring force, −kx, is replaced by the tangential gravitational
force, −mg sin θ ≈ −mg(x/(cid:2)). So after a time

the pendulum that was initially oscillating is now momentarily at rest, and the other

The existence of the “beats” in Fig. 4.30 can be traced to the fact that the expressions
in Eq. (4.98) are linear combinations of sinusoidal functions with two very close
frequencies. The physics here is the same as the physics that produces the beats you
hear when listening to two musical notes of nearly the same pitch, as when tuning
a guitar.8 The time between the zeros of, say, x1 in Fig. 4.30 is π/(cid:9), so the angular
frequency of the beats is 2π/(π/(cid:9)) = 2(cid:9). ♣

4.11. Driven mass on a circle

Label two diametrically opposite points as the equilibrium positions. Let the positions
of the masses relative to these points be x1 and x2, measured counterclockwise. If the
driving force acts on mass “1,” then the F = ma equations are

m¨x1 + 2k(x1 − x2) = Fd cos ωdt,
m¨x2 + 2k(x2 − x1) = 0.

(4.104)

To solve these equations, we can treat the driving force as the real part of Fdeiωd t
and try solutions of the form x1(t) = A1eiωd t and x2(t) = A2eiωd t, and then solve for
A1 and A2. Or we can try some trig functions. If we take the latter route, we quickly
find that the solutions can’t involve any sine terms (this is due to the fact that there
are no first derivatives of the x’s in Eq. (4.104)). Therefore, the trig functions must
look like x1(t) = A1 cos ωdt and x2(t) = A2 cos ωdt. Using either of the two methods,
Eq. (4.104) becomes

note with a frequency equal to the difference of the original frequencies (and possibly some other
notes too, involving various combinations of the frequencies). But this is a different phenomenon
from the above beats; it is due to the nonlinear way in which the ear works. See Hall (1981) for
more details.

134

Oscillations

The most general solution is the sum of this particular solution and the homogeneous
solution found in Eq. (4.111) in the solution to Problem 4.12 below.

Remarks:

√

1. If ωd = 2ω, the amplitudes of the motions go to infinity. This makes sense,
considering that there is no damping, and that the natural frequency of the system
(calculated in Problem 4.12) is 2ω.

2. If ωd =

2ω, then the mass that is being driven doesn’t move. The reason for
this is that the driving force balances the force that the mass feels from the two
2ω is
springs due to the other mass’s motion. And indeed, you can show that
the frequency that one mass moves at if the other mass is at rest (and thereby
acts essentially like a brick wall). Note that ωd =
2ω is the cutoff between the
masses moving in the same direction or in opposite directions.

√

√

3. If ωd → ∞, then both motions go to zero. But x2 is fourth-order small, whereas

x1 is only second-order small.

4. If ωd → 0, then A1 ≈ A2 ≈ −F/2ω2

d, which is very large. The slowly changing
driving force basically spins the masses around in one direction for a while, and
then reverses and spins them around in the other direction. We essentially have the
driving force acting on a mass 2m, and two integrations of Fd cos ωdt = (2m)¨x
show that the amplitude of the motion is F/2ω2
d, as above. Equivalently, you can
calculate the A1 − A2 difference in the ωd → 0 limit to show that the springs
stretch just the right amount to cause there to be a net force of (Fd/2) cos ωdt on
each mass. This leads to the same F/2ω2

d amplitude. ♣

4.12. Springs on a circle

(a) Label two diametrically opposite points as the equilibrium positions. Let
the positions of the masses relative to these points be x1 and x2, measured
counterclockwise. Then the F = ma equations are
m¨x1 + 2k(x1 − x2) = 0,
m¨x2 + 2k(x2 − x1) = 0.

(4.107)

The determinant method works here, but let’s just do it the easy way. Adding
the equations gives

¨x1 + ¨x2 = 0,

and subtracting them gives

(¨x1 − ¨x2) + 4ω2(x1 − x2) = 0.

The normal coordinates are therefore

x1 + x2 = At + B,
x1 − x2 = C cos(2ωt + φ).

The first mode has frequency zero. It corresponds to the masses sliding around
the circle, equally spaced, at constant speed. The second mode has both masses
moving to the left, then both to the right, back and forth. Each mass feels a force
of 4kx (because there are two springs, and each one stretches by 2x), hence the
√

4 = 2 in the frequency.

(b) Label three equally spaced points as the equilibrium positions. Let the posi-
tions of the masses relative to these points be x1, x2, and x3, measured
counterclockwise. Then the F = ma equations are, as you can show,

m¨x1 + k(x1 − x2) + k(x1 − x3) = 0,
m¨x2 + k(x2 − x3) + k(x2 − x1) = 0,
m¨x3 + k(x3 − x1) + k(x3 − x2) = 0.

differences between any two of the equations give something useful. But let’s

Setting the determinant equal to zero yields a cubic equation in α2. But it’s a
nice cubic equation, with α2 = 0 as a solution. The other solution is the double
root α2 = 3ω2.

The α = 0 root corresponds to A1 = A2 = A3. That is, it corresponds to the
vector (1, 1, 1). This α = 0 case is the one case where our exponential solution
isn’t really an exponential. But α2 equalling zero in Eq. (4.114) basically tells
us that we’re dealing with a function whose second derivative is zero, that is, a
linear function At + B. Therefore, the normal mode is

This mode has frequency zero. It corresponds to the masses sliding around the

The two α2 = 3ω2 roots correspond to a two-dimensional subspace of normal
modes. You can show that any vector of the form (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 0

(0, 1, −1) and (1, 0, −1) as basis vectors for this space. We can then write the

Remarks: The α2 = 3ω2 case is very similar to the example in Section 4.5
with two masses and three springs oscillating between two walls. The way we’ve
written the two modes in Eq. (4.116), the first one has the first mass stationary
(so there could be a wall there, for all the other two masses know). Similarly for
the second mode. Hence the

The normal coordinates in this problem are x1+x2+x3 (obtained by adding the
three equations in (4.113)), and also any combination of the form ax1 +bx2 +cx3,
where a + b + c = 0 (obtained by taking a times the first equation in Eq. (4.113),
plus b times the second, plus c times the third). The three normal coordinates
that correspond to the mode in Eq. (4.115) and the two modes we chose in Eq.
(4.116) are, respectively, x1 + x2 + x3, x1 − 2x2 + x3, and −2x1 + x2 + x3,
because each of these combinations gets no contribution from the other two
modes (demanding this is how you can derive the coefficients of the xi’s, up to
an overall constant). ♣

In the matrix M , the three consecutive 1’s keep shifting to the right, and they
wrap around cyclicly. We must now find the eigenvectors of M , which will
require being a little clever.

We can guess the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of M if we take a hint from
its cyclic nature. A particular set of things that are rather cyclic are the N th roots
of 1. If β is an N th root of 1, you can verify that (1, β, β2, . . . , βN −1) is an
eigenvector of M with eigenvalue β−1 + 1 + β. (This general method works for
any matrix where the entries keep shifting to the right. The entries don’t have
to be equal.) The eigenvalues of the entire matrix in Eq. (4.118) are therefore
3 − (β−1 + 1 + β) = 2 − β−1 − β. There are N different N th roots of 1, namely
βn = e2π in/N , for 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1. So the N eigenvalues are

Since the numbers n and N − n yield the same value for λn in Eq. (4.119),

This is fortunate, because we can then form real linear combinations of the

upon by M . That is, M v = λv, where λ is some number (the eigenvalue). This can be rewritten as
(M − λI )v = 0, where I is the identity matrix. By our usual reasoning about invertible matrices,
a nonzero vector v exists only if λ satisfies det |M − λI | = 0.

both have eigenvalue λn = λN −n (as does any linear combination of these
vectors). For the special case of n = 0, the eigenvector is V0 = (1, 1, 1, . . . , 1)
with eigenvalue λ0 = 0. And for the special case of n = N /2 if N is even, the
eigenvector is VN /2 = (1, −1, 1, . . . , −1) with eigenvalue λN /2 = 4.

Referring back to the N = 3 case in Eq. (4.114), we see that we must take the
square root of the eigenvalues and then multiply by ω to obtain the frequencies
(because it was an α2 that appeared in the matrix, and because we dropped the
factor of ω2). The frequency corresponding to the above two normal modes is
therefore, using Eq. (4.119),

(cid:4)

ωn = ω

λn = 2ω sin(πn/N ).

(4.123)

For even N , the largest value of the frequency is 2ω, with the masses moving
in alternating equal positive and negative displacements. But for odd N , it is
slightly less than 2ω.

To sum everything up, the N normal modes are the vectors in Eqs. (4.121)
and (4.122), where n runs from 1 up to the greatest integer less than N /2. And
then we have to add on the V0 vector, and also the VN /2 vector if N is even.10
The frequencies are given in Eq. (4.123). Each frequency is associated with two
modes, except the V0 mode and the VN /2 mode if N is even.

Remark: Let’s check our results for N = 2 and N = 3. For N = 2: The values
of n are the two “special” cases of n = 0 and n = N /2 = 1. If n = 0, we have
ω0 = 0 and V0 = (1, 1). If n = 1, we have ω1 = 2ω and V1 = (1, −1). These
results agree with the two modes in Eq. (4.112).

For N = 3: If n = 0, we have ω0 = 0 and V0 = (1, 1, 1), in agreement
= (1, −1/2, −1/2)
with Eq. (4.115). If n = 1, we have ω1 =
−
= (0, 1/2, −1/2). These two vectors span the same space we found in
and V

Eq. (4.116). And they have the same frequency as in Eq. (4.116). You can also
find the vectors for N = 4. These are fairly intuitive, so try to write them down

Chapter 5
Conservation of energy and
momentum

Conservation laws are extremely important in physics. They are enormously
helpful, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in figuring out what is going on in
a physical system. When we say that something is “conserved,” we mean that
it is constant over time. If a certain quantity is conserved, for example, while a
ball rolls around in a valley, or while a group of particles interact, then the possi-
ble final motions are greatly restricted. If we can write down enough conserved
quantities (which we are generally able to do, at least for the systems we’ll be
concerned with), then we can restrict the final motions down to just one possibil-
ity, and so we have solved our problem. Conservation of energy and momentum
are two of the main conservation laws in physics. A third, conservation of angular
momentum, is discussed in Chapters 7–9.

It should be noted that it isn’t necessary (in principle) to use conservation of
energy and momentum when solving a problem. We’ll derive these conservation
laws from Newton’s laws. Therefore, if you felt like it, you could always (in
theory) simply start with first principles and use F = ma, etc. However, at best,
you would soon grow weary of this approach. And at worst, you would throw
in the towel after finding the problem completely intractable. For example, you
would get nowhere trying to analyze the collision between two shopping carts
(whose contents are free to shift around) by looking at the forces on all the various
objects. But conservation of momentum can quickly give you a great deal of
information. The point of conservation laws is that they make your calculations
much easier, and they also provide a means for getting a good idea of the overall
qualitative behavior of a system.

5.1 Conservation of energy in one dimension

Consider a force, in just one dimension for now, that depends only on position.
That is, F = F(x). If the force acts on a particle of mass m, and if we write a as
v dv/dx, then F = ma becomes

F(x) = mv dv
dx

.

done here is simply follow the procedure in Section 3.3, for a function that
depends only on x. If we now define the potential energy, V (x), as

(5.4)

We define the first term here to be the kinetic energy. Since this equation is
true at all points in the particle’s motion, the sum of the kinetic energy and
potential energy is constant. In other words, the total energy is conserved. If a
particle loses (or gains) potential energy, then its speed increases (or decreases).
Common examples of potential energy are kx2/2 for a Hooke’s-law spring force
(−kx), with x0 chosen to be zero; and mgy for the gravitational force (−mg), with
y0 chosen to be zero.

In Boston, lived Jack as did Jill,
Who gained mgh on a hill.
In their liquid pursuit,
Jill exclaimed with a hoot,
“I think we’ve just climbed a landfill!”

While noting, “Oh, this is just grand,”
Jack tripped on some trash in the sand.
He changed his potential
To kinetic, torrential,
But not before grabbing Jill’s hand.

So that’s what really happened on that hill. People don’t just magically come
“tumbling after” for no reason, of course.

For a particle undergoing a given motion, both E and V (x) depend on the
arbitrary choice of x0 in Eq. (5.3). This implies that E and V (x) have no real
meaning by themselves. Only the difference between E and V (x) is relevant (and

140

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

F dy = −

it equals the kinetic energy); this difference is independent of the choice of x0.
But in order to be concrete in a given setup, we need to pick an arbitrary x0, so we
must remember to state which x0 we’ve chosen. For example, it makes no sense
to simply say that the gravitational potential energy of an object at height y above
(−mg) dy = mgy. We have to say that the potential
the ground is −
energy is mgy with respect to the ground (assuming that our y0 is at ground level).
If we wanted to, we could say that the potential energy is mgy + mg(7 m) with
respect to a point 7 meters below the ground. This is perfectly legitimate, although
a bit unconventional.1 But no matter what reference point we pick, the difference
in the potential energies at the points, say, y = 3 m and y = 5 m equals mg(2 m).
Note that although we introduced the x0 in Eq. (5.2) as a point where the
particle was at some time, the particle in fact need not ever be at the point x0. For
example, we can throw a ball up at 8 m/s from a height of 5 m while measuring the
gravitational potential energy with respect to a point a kilometer high. The ball is
certainly not going to reach a height of a kilometer, but that’s fine. All that matters
is the difference between E and V (x) (both of which are very much negative here)
throughout the motion, so a constant shift is irrelevant. We’ve simply added on
the same negative quantity to both E and V (x) in Eq. (5.4), compared with the
values someone would measure if the ground were the reference point.

If we take the difference between Eq. (5.4) evaluated at two points, x1 and x2

(or if we just integrate Eq. (5.1) from x1 to x2), then we obtain

(5.5)

Here it is clear that only differences in potential energies matter. If we define the
integral in this equation to be the work done on the particle as it moves from x1
to x2, then we have produced the work–energy theorem:2

Theorem 5.1 The change in a particle’s kinetic energy between points x1
and x2 equals the work done on the particle between x1 and x2.

If the force points in the same direction as the motion (that is, if the F(x) and
the dx in Eq. (5.5) have the same sign), then the work is positive and the speed
increases. If the force points in the direction opposite to the motion, then the
work is negative and the speed decreases.

1 It gets to be a pain to keep repeating “with respect to the ground.” Therefore, whenever anyone talks
about gravitational potential energy in a setup on the surface of the earth, it’s generally understood
that the ground is the reference point. If, on the other hand, the experiment reaches out to distances
far from the earth, then r = ∞ is understood to be the reference point, for reasons of convenience
we will see in the first example below.

2 In the form stated here, this theorem holds only for a point particle with no internal structure. See

the “Work vs. potential energy” subsection below for the general theorem.

Fig. 5.1

Referring back to Eq. (5.4), and assuming we’ve chosen a reference point
x0 for the potential energy (and perhaps we’ve added on a constant to V (x),
just because we felt like it), let’s draw in Fig. 5.1 the V (x) curve and also the
constant E line (which we can determine if we’re given, say, the initial position
and speed). Then the difference between E and V (x) gives the kinetic energy. The
places where V (x) > E are the regions where the particle cannot go. The places
where V (x) = E are the “turning points” where the particle stops and changes
direction. In the figure, the particle is trapped between x1 and x2, and oscillates
back and forth. The potential V (x) is extremely useful this way because it makes
clear the general properties of the motion.

Remark:
It may seem silly to introduce a specific x0 as a reference point, considering that
it’s only the differences in the potential (which are independent of x0) that have any meaning.
It’s sort of like taking the difference between 17 and 8 by first finding their sizes relative to
5, namely 12 and 3, and then subtracting 3 from 12 to obtain 9. However, since integrals are
harder to do than simple subtractions, it’s advantageous to do the integral once and for all and
thereby label all positions with a definite number V (x), and to then take differences between
the V ’s when needed. ♣

The differential form of Eq. (5.3) is

F(x) = − dV (x)
dx

.

(5.6)

Given V (x), it is easy to take its derivative to obtain F(x). But given F(x), it
may be difficult (or impossible) to perform the integration in Eq. (5.3) and write
V (x) in closed form. But this is not of much concern. The function V (x) is well
defined (assuming that the force is a function of x only), and if needed it can be
computed numerically to any desired accuracy.

Example (Gravitational potential energy): Consider two point masses, M
and m, separated by a distance r. Newton’s law of gravitation says that the force
between them is attractive and has magnitude GMm/r2 (we’ll talk more about gravity
in Section 5.4.1). The potential energy of the system at separation r, measured relative
to separation r0, is therefore

where the minus sign in the integrand comes from the attractive nature of the force. A

understood from now on that this r0 = ∞ reference point has been chosen. Therefore

of a mass m at height y, relative to the ground? We know, of course, that it is

then Eq. (5.8) gives (assuming y (cid:4) R)

(5.9)

where we have used the Taylor series approximation for 1/(1 + (cid:9)) to obtain the second
line. We have also used the fact that a sphere can be treated like a point mass, as far
as gravity is concerned. We’ll prove this in Section 5.4.1.

Using g ≡ GM/R2, we see that the potential energy difference in Eq. (5.9) equals
mgy. We have, of course, simply gone around in circles here. We integrated in
Eq. (5.7), and then we basically differentiated in Eq. (5.9) by taking the difference
between the forces at nearby points. But it’s good to check that everything works out.

A good way to visualize a potential V (x) is to imagine a ball sliding around in a
valley or on a hill. For example, the potential of a typical spring is V (x) = kx2/2
(this produces the Hooke’s-law force, F(x) = −dV/dx = −kx), and we can get
a decent idea of what is going on if we imagine a valley with height given by
y = x2/2. The gravitational potential of the ball is then mgy = mgx2/2. Choosing
mg = k gives the desired potential. If we then look at the projection of the ball’s
motion on the x axis, it seems like we have constructed a setup identical to the
original spring.

However, although this analogy helps in visualizing the basic properties of
the motion, the two setups are not the same. The details of this fact are left
for Problem 5.7, but the following observation should convince you that they
are indeed different. Let the ball be released from rest in both setups at a large
value of x. Then the force kx due to the spring is very large. But the force in
the x direction on the particle in the valley is only a fraction of mg, namely
(mg sin θ) cos θ, where θ is the angle of the valley at that point. The setups are
approximately the same, however, for small oscillations near the bottom of the
valley. See Problem 5.7 for more details.

Conservative forces
Given any force (it can depend on x, v, t, and/or whatever), the work it does on
a particle is defined by W ≡
F dx. If the particle starts at x1 and ends up at
x2, then no matter how it gets there (it might speed up or slow down, or reverse
direction a few times), we can calculate the total work done on it by all the forces

(cid:17)

(5.10)

For some forces, the work done is independent of how the particle moves.
A force that depends only on position (in one dimension) has this property,
because the integral in Eq. (5.10) depends only on the endpoints. The W =
F dx
integral is the (signed) area under the F vs. x graph, and this area is independent
of how the particle goes from x1 to x2.

(cid:17)

For other forces, the work done depends on how the particle moves. Such is
the case for forces that depend on t or v, because it then matters when or how
quickly the particle goes from x1 to x2. A common example of such a force is
friction. If you slide a brick across a table from x1 to x2, then the work done
by friction equals −µmg|(cid:16)x|. But if you slide the brick by wiggling it back
and forth for an hour before you finally reach x2, then the amount of negative
work done by friction is very large. Since friction always opposes the motion, the
contributions to the W =
F dx integral are always negative, so there is never
any cancellation. The result is therefore a large negative number.

(cid:17)

The issue with friction is that although the µmg force looks like a constant
force (which is a subset of position-only dependent forces), it actually isn’t. At a
given location, the friction can point to the right or to the left, depending on
which way the particle is moving. Friction is therefore a function of velocity.
True, it’s a function only of the direction of the velocity, but that’s enough to ruin
the position-only dependence.

We now define a conservative force as one for which the work done on a
particle between two given points is independent of how the particle makes the
journey. From the preceding discussion, we know that a one-dimensional force
is conservative if and only if it depends only on x (or is constant).3 The point
we’re leading up to here is that although we can calculate the work done by any
force, it makes sense to talk about the potential energy associated with a force
only if the force is conservative. This is true because we want to be able to label
each value of x with a unique number, V (x), given by V (x) = −
F dx. If this
integral were dependent on how the particle goes from x0 to x, then it wouldn’t be
well defined, so we wouldn’t know what number to assign to V (x). We therefore
talk about potential energies only if they are associated with conservative forces.
In particular, it makes no sense to talk about the potential energy associated with
a friction force.

(cid:17)

A useful fact about the gravitational potential energy, mgz, is that it doesn’t
depend on the path the particle takes, even in two or three dimensions. This
is true because even if the particle moves in a complicated direction, only the

3 In two or three dimensions, however, we will see in Section 7 that a conservative force must satisfy

another requirement, in addition to being dependent only on position.

144

Conservation of energy and momentum

vertical z component of the displacement is relevant in calculating the work done
by gravity. If we break the path up into many little pieces, the total work done
by gravity is obtained by adding up the many little −mg(dz) terms. But the sum
of all the dz’s is always equal to the total z, independent of the path. Therefore,
no matter what the particle is doing in the two horizontal directions, the change
in gravitational potential energy is always just mgz. So the gravitational force is
a conservative force in three dimensions. We’ll see in Section 5.3 that this is a
special case of a more general result.

Example (Unwinding string): A mass is connected to one end of a massless
string, the other end of which is connected to a very thin frictionless vertical pole.
The string is initially wound completely around the pole, in a very large number of
tiny horizontal circles, so that the mass touches the pole. The mass is released, and
the string gradually unwinds. What angle does the string make with the pole at the
moment it becomes completely unwound?

Solution: Let (cid:2) be the length of the string, and let θ be the final angle it makes with
the pole. Then the final height of the mass is (cid:2) cos θ below the starting point. So the
mass loses a potential energy of mg((cid:2) cos θ). Conservation of energy therefore gives
(picking the initial height as y = 0, although this doesn’t matter)

Ki + Vi = Kf + Vf =⇒ 0 + 0 = 1
2

mv2 − mg(cid:2) cos θ =⇒ v2 = 2g(cid:2) cos θ.

(5.11)

There are two unknowns here, v and θ, so we need one more equation. This will be the
radial F = ma equation for the (essentially) final circular motion. Because the pole is
very thin, the motion can always be approximated by a horizontal circle, which very
slowly lowers as time goes by. Because there is essentially no motion in the vertical
direction, the total force in this direction is zero. Therefore, the vertical component
of the tension is essentially mg. The horizontal component is then mg tan θ, so the
F = ma equation for the final circular motion (which has a radius of (cid:2) sin θ) is

mg tan θ = mv2
(cid:2) sin θ

=⇒ v2 = g(cid:2) sin θ tan θ.

(5.12)

Equating our two expressions for v2 gives tan θ =
this angle is independent of (cid:2) and g.

Work vs. potential energy
When you drop a ball, does its speed increase because the gravitational force is
doing work on it, or because its gravitational potential energy is decreasing? Well,
both (or more precisely, either). Work and potential energy are two different ways
of talking about the same thing (at least for conservative forces). Either method of

5.1 Conservation of energy in one dimension

145

reasoning gives the correct result. However, be careful not to use both reasonings
and “double count” the effect of gravity on the ball. Which choice of terminology
you use depends on what you call your “system.” Just as with F = ma and free-
body diagrams, it is important to label your system when dealing with work and
energy, as we’ll see in the example below.

The work–energy theorem stated in Theorem 5.1 is relevant to one particle.
What if we are dealing with the work done on a system that is composed of
various parts? The general work–energy theorem states that the work done on a
system by external forces equals the change in energy of the system. This energy
may come in the form of (1) overall kinetic energy, (2) internal potential energy,
or (3) internal kinetic energy (heat falls into this category, because it’s simply
the random motion of molecules). So we can write the general work–energy
theorem as

Wexternal = (cid:16)K + (cid:16)V + (cid:16)Kinternal

(5.13)

For a point particle, there is no internal structure, so we have only the first of
the three terms on the right-hand side, in agreement with Theorem 5.1. But to
see what happens when a system has internal structure, consider the following
example.

Example (Raising a book): Assume that you lift a book up at constant speed, so
there is no change in kinetic energy. Let’s see what the general work–energy theorem
says for various choices of the system.

• System = (book): Both you and gravity are external forces, and there is no
change in the energy of the book as a system in itself. So the W–E theorem says

Wyou + Wgrav = 0 ⇐⇒ mgh + (−mgh) = 0.

(5.14)

• System = (book + earth): Now you are the only external force. The gravitational
force between the earth and the book is an internal force which produces an
internal potential energy. So the W–E theorem says

Wyou = (cid:16)Vearth–book ⇐⇒ mgh = mgh.

(5.15)

• System = (book + earth + you): There is now no external force. The internal
energy of the system changes because the earth–book gravitational potential
energy increases, and also because your potential energy decreases. In order to
lift the book, you have to burn some calories from the dinner you ate. So the
W–E theorem says

0 = (cid:16)Vearth–book + (cid:16)Vyou ⇐⇒ 0 = mgh + (−mgh).

(5.16)

146

Conservation of energy and momentum

Actually, a human body isn’t 100% efficient, so what really happens here is that
your potential energy decreases by more than mgh, but heat is produced. The
sum of these two changes in energy equals −mgh. So, including an amount η of
energy in the form of heat, we have

0 = (cid:16)Vearth–book + (cid:16)Vyou + (cid:16)Kinternal

⇐⇒ 0 = mgh + (−mgh − η) + η.

(5.17)

Another contribution to this η heat term can come from, for example, the heat
from friction if you slide the book up a rough wall as you lift it.4

The moral of all this is that you can look at a setup in various ways, depending
on what you pick as your system. Potential energy in one way might show up
as work in another. In practice, it is usually more convenient to work in terms
of potential energy. So for a dropped ball, people usually consider (consciously
or not) gravity to be an internal force in the earth–ball system, as opposed to an
external force on the ball system. In general, “conservation of energy,” commonly
used in setups involving gravity and/or springs, is a straightforward principle to
apply (and you’ll get plenty of practice with it in the problems and exercises for
this chapter). So it turns out that you can usually ignore all these issues about
work and about picking your system.

But let’s look at one more example, just to make sure we’re on the same
page. Consider a car that is braking (but not skidding). The friction force from
the ground on the tires is what causes the car to slow down. But this force
does no work on the car, because the ground isn’t moving; the force acts over
zero distance. So the external work on the left side of Eq. (5.13) is zero. The
right side is therefore also zero. That is, the total energy of the car doesn’t
change. This is indeed true, because although the overall kinetic energy of the
car decreases, there is an equal increase in internal kinetic energy in the form
of heat in the brake pads and discs. In other words, (cid:16)K = −(cid:16)Kinternal, and the
total energy remains constant. The unfortunate fact about this process is that the
energy that goes into heat is lost and can’t be converted back into overall kinetic
energy of the car. It makes much more sense to convert the overall kinetic energy
into some form of internal potential energy (that is, (cid:16)K = −(cid:16)U ), which can
then be converted back into overall kinetic energy. Such is the case with hybrid
cars which convert overall kinetic energy into chemical potential energy in a
battery.

Conversely, when a car accelerates, the friction force from the ground does
no work (because the ground isn’t moving), so the total energy of the car remains

4 In this case we have included the wall as a fourth object in our system, because it might contain
some of the heat. If you want to instead consider the wall as an external object providing a force,
then things get tricky; see Problem 5.6.

5.2 Small oscillations

147

the same. The internal potential energy of the gasoline (or battery) is converted
into overall kinetic energy (along with some heat and sound). A similar thing
happens when you stand at rest and then start walking. The friction force from
the ground does no work on you, so your total energy remains the same. You’re
simply trading your breakfast for overall kinetic energy (plus some heat). For
further discussion of work, see Mallinckrodt and Leff (1992).

5.2 Small oscillations
Consider an object in one dimension, subject to the potential V (x). Let the object
initially be at rest at a local minimum of V (x), and then let it be given a small
kick so that it moves back and forth around the equilibrium point. What can we
say about this motion? Is it simple harmonic? Does the frequency depend on the
amplitude?

It turns out that for small amplitudes, the motion is indeed simple harmonic,
and the frequency can easily be found, given V (x). To see this, expand V (x) in
a Taylor series around the equilibrium point, x0,
(cid:16)(x0)(x − x0) + 1
2! V
(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)(x − x0)3 + · · · .

V (x) = V (x0) + V

(cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)(x − x0)2

+ 1

(5.18)

3! V

This looks like a bit of a mess, but we can simplify it greatly. V (x0) is an irrelevant
additive constant. We can ignore it because only differences in energy matter (or
equivalently, because F = −dV/dx). And V (cid:16)(x0) = 0, by definition of the
equilibrium point. So that leaves us with the V (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0) and higher-order terms.
But for sufficiently small displacements, these higher-order terms are negligible
compared with the V (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0) term, because they are suppressed by additional powers
of (x − x0). So we are left with5

V (x) ≈ 1
2

(cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)(x − x0)2.

V

(5.19)

But this has exactly the same form as the Hooke’s-law potential, V (x) =
(1/2)k(x − x0)2, provided that we let V (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0) be our “spring constant” k. Equiv-
alently, the force is F = −dV/dx = −V (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)(x − x0) ≡ −k(x − x0). The
(cid:4)
frequency of small oscillations, ω =

k/m, is therefore

(cid:1)

ω =

V (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)
m

.

(5.20)

5 Even if V

(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)(x0) is much larger than V

(cid:16)(cid:16)(x0), we can always pick (x − x0) small enough so that
(cid:16)(cid:16)(x0) = 0. But the
the third-order term is negligible. The one case where this is not true is when V
result in Eq. (5.20) is still valid in this case. The frequency ω just happens to be zero, in the limit
of infinitesimal oscillations.

5.3 Conservation of energy in three dimensions

The concepts of work and potential energy in three dimensions are somewhat
more complicated than in one dimension, but the general ideas are the same.6 As
in the 1-D case, we’ll start with Newton’s second law, which now takes the vector
form, F = ma. And as in the 1-D case, we’ll deal only with forces that depend
only on position, that is, F = F(r), because these are the only ones that have
any chance of being conservative. The F = ma vector equation is shorthand for
three equations analogous to Eq. (5.1), namely mvx(dvx/dx) = Fx, and likewise
for y and z. The Fx here is a function of position, so we should really be writing

6 We’ll invoke a few results from vector calculus here. If you haven’t seen such material before, a

brief review is given in Appendix B.

5.3 Conservation of energy in three dimensions

149

Fx(x, y, z), but we’ll drop the arguments, lest our expressions get too cluttered.
Multiplying through by dx, etc., in these three equations, and then adding them
together gives

Fx dx + Fy dy + Fz dz = m(vx dvx + vy dvy + vz dvz).

(5.24)

The left-hand side is the work done on the particle. With dr ≡ (dx, dy, dz),
this work can be written as F · dr (see Appendix B for the definition of the “dot
product”). Using Eq. (B.2), we see that the work can also be written as F|dr| cos θ,
where θ is the angle between F and dr. Grouping this as (F cos θ)|dr| shows
that the work equals the distance moved times the component of the force along
the displacement. Alternatively, grouping it as F(|dr| cos θ) shows that the work
also equals the magnitude of the force times the component of the displacement
in the direction of the force.

Integrating Eq. (5.24) from the point (x0, y0, z0) to the point (x, y, z) yields7

in 3-D space that the particle takes in going from (x0, y0, z0) to (x, y, z), because
the components of F are functions of position. We’ll address this issue below.

Conservation of energy and momentum

Conservative forces in three dimensions
For a force that depends only on position (as we have been assuming), there is
one complication that arises in 3-D that we didn’t have to worry about in 1-D.
In 1-D, there is only one route that goes from x0 to x. The motion itself may
involve speeding up or slowing down, or backtracking, but the path is always
restricted to be along the line containing x0 and x. But in 3-D, there is an infinite
number of routes that go from r0 to r. In order for the potential V (r) to have
any meaning and to be of any use, it must be well defined. That is, it must be
path-independent. As in the 1-D case, we call the force associated with such
a potential a conservative force. Let’s now see what types of 3-D forces are
conservative.

Theorem 5.2 Given a force F(r), a necessary and sufficient condition for the
potential,

V (r) ≡ −

(cid:14)

r

r0

F(r

(cid:16)) · dr

(cid:16)

,

(5.29)

to be well defined (that is, to be path-independent) is that the curl of F is zero
everywhere (that is, ∇ × F = 0; see Appendix B for the definition of the curl).8

let us show that ∇ × F = 0 is a necessary condition for
Proof: First,
path-independence. In other words, “If V (r) is path-independent, then ∇ ×
F = 0.” This follows quickly from the discussion of the curl in Appendix B.
(cid:17)
F · dr (that is, the work done) around a
We show in Eq. (B.24) that the integral
little rectangle in the x-y plane equals the z component of the curl times the area.
If the work done in going from corner A to corner B in Fig. 5.5 is the same for
paths “1” and “2” (as we are assuming), then the round-trip integral around the
rectangle is zero, because one of the paths is being traced out backwards, so it
cancels the contribution from the other path. So path-independence implies that
F · dr is zero for any arbitrary rectangle in the x-y plane.
the round-trip integral
Equation (B.24) therefore says that the z component of the curl must be zero
everywhere. Likewise for the y and x components. We have therefore shown that
∇ × F = 0 is a necessary condition for path independence.

(cid:17)

Now let us show that it is sufficient. In other words, “If ∇ × F = 0, then
V (r) is path-independent.” The proof of sufficiency follows immediately from
Stokes’ theorem, which is stated in Eq. (B.25). This theorem implies that if
∇ × F = 0 everywhere, then
C F · dr = 0 for any closed curve. But Fig. 5.6
shows that traversing the loop C counterclockwise entails traversing path “1” in
the “forward” direction, and then traversing path “2” in the “backward” direction.
Therefore, from the same reasoning as in the previous paragraph, the integrals

(cid:17)

8 If the force is infinite at any point, then the proof of sufficiency below (which is based on Stokes’
theorem) isn’t valid, and it turns out that a second condition is required; see Feng (1969). But we
won’t worry about that here.

from r0 to r along paths “1” and “2” are equal. This holds for arbitrary points r0
(cid:1)
and r, and arbitrary curves C, so V (r) is path-independent.

Remark: Another way to show that ∇ ×F = 0 is a necessary condition for path-independence
(that is, “If V (r) is path-independent, then ∇ × F = 0”) is the following. If V (r) is path-
independent (and therefore well defined), then it is legal to write down the differential form of
Eq. (5.27), namely

dV (r) = −F(r) · dr ≡ −(Fx dx + Fy dy + Fz dz).

(5.30)

But another expression for dV is

dV (r) =

∂V
∂x

dx +

∂V

(5.31)

=⇒ F(r) = −∇V (r).

(5.32)

In other words, the force is the gradient of the potential. Therefore,

∇ × F = −∇ × ∇V (r) = 0,

(5.33)

because the curl of a gradient is identically zero, as you can verify by using the definition of the
curl in Eq. (B.20) and the fact that partial differentiation is commutative (that is, ∂ 2V/∂x ∂y =
∂ 2V/∂y ∂x). ♣

Example (Central force): A central force is defined to be a force that points
radially and whose magnitude depends only on r. That is, F(r) = F(r)ˆr. Show that
a central force is conservative by explicitly showing that ∇ × F = 0.

Solution: The force F may be written as

F(x, y, z) = F(r)ˆr = F(r)

5.4 Gravity

5.4.1 Newton’s universal law of gravitation

The gravitational force on a point mass m, located a distance r from a point mass
M, is given by Newton’s law of gravitation,

F(r) =

−GMm
r2

,

(5.37)

where the minus sign indicates an attractive force. The numerical value of G
is 6.67 · 10−11 m3/(kg s2). We’ll show how this value is obtained in Section
5.4.2 below.

What is the force if we replace the point mass M by a sphere of radius R and
mass M ? The answer (assuming that the sphere is spherically symmetric, that
is, the density is a function only of r) is that it is still −GMm/r2. A sphere acts
just like a point mass at its center, for the purposes of gravity (as long as we’re
considering a mass m outside the sphere). This is an extremely pleasing result,
to say the least. If it were not the case, then the universe would be a far more
complicated place than it is. In particular, the motion of planets and such things
would be much harder to describe.

To demonstrate that spheres behave like points, as far as gravity is concerned,
it turns out to be much easier to calculate the potential energy due to a sphere, and
to then take the derivative to obtain the force, rather than to calculate the force
explicitly.9 So this is the route we will take. It will suffice to demonstrate the
result for a thin spherical shell, because a sphere is the sum of many such shells.
Our strategy for calculating the potential energy at a point P, due to a spherical
shell, will be to slice the shell into rings as shown in Fig. 5.7. Let the radius of
the shell be R, let P be a distance r from the center of the shell, and let the ring
make the angle θ shown. The distance, (cid:2), from P to the ring is a function of R,
r, and θ. It may be found as follows. In Fig. 5.8, segment AB has length R sin θ,
and segment BP has length r − R cos θ. So the length (cid:2) in triangle ABP is

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

(cid:2) =

(R sin θ)2 + (r − R cos θ)2 =

R2 + r2 − 2rR cos θ.

(5.38)

What we’ve done here is just prove the law of cosines.

The area of a ring between θ and θ + dθ is its width (which is R dθ) times its
circumference (which is 2πR sin θ). Letting σ = M/(4πR2) be the mass density
per unit area of the shell, we see that the potential energy of a mass m at P due to
a thin ring is −Gmσ (R dθ)(2πR sin θ)/(cid:2). This is true because the gravitational
potential energy,

V ((cid:2)) =

−Gm1m2
(cid:2)

,

(5.39)

9 The reason for this is that the potential energy is a scalar quantity (just a number), whereas the
force is a vector. If we tried to calculate the force, we would have to worry about forces pointing
in all sorts of directions. With the potential energy, we simply have to add up a bunch of numbers.

5.4 Gravity

153

is a scalar quantity, so the contributions from the little mass pieces simply add.
Every piece of the ring is the same distance from P, and this distance is all that
matters; the direction from P is irrelevant (unlike it would be with the force).
The total potential energy at P is therefore

desired. If r < R, then we have

(r + R) − (R − r)

= − GMm

(cid:8)

which is independent of r. Having found V (r), we can now find F(r) by taking
the negative of the gradient of V . The gradient is just ˆr(d/dr) here, because V is
a function only of r. Therefore,

(5.42)

F(r) = − GMm

if r < R.

F(r) = 0,

if r > R,

(5.43)

These forces are directed radially, of course. A solid sphere is the sum of many
spherical shells, so if P is outside a given sphere, then the force at P is −GMm/r2,
where M is the total mass of the sphere. This result holds even if the shells have
different mass densities (but each one must have uniform density). Note that the
gravitational force between two spheres is the same as if they were both replaced
by point masses. This follows from two applications of our “point mass” result.

Newton looked at the data, numerical,
And then observations, empirical.
He said, “But, of course,
We get the same force
From a point mass and something that’s spherical!”

If P is inside a given sphere, then the only relevant material is the mass inside
a concentric sphere through P, because all the shells outside this region give zero

force, from the second equation in Eq. (5.43). The material “outside” of P is, for
the purposes of gravity, not there.

It isn’t obvious that the force inside a spherical shell is zero. Consider the
point P in Fig. 5.9. A piece of mass dm on the right side of the shell gives a larger
force on P than a piece of mass dm on the left side, due to the 1/r2 dependence.
But from the figure, there is more mass on the left side than the right side. These
two effects happen to exactly cancel, as you can show in Problem 5.10.

P

Imagine the following unrealistic undertaking.
Example (Supporting a tube):
Drill a narrow tube, with cross-sectional area A, from the surface of the earth down
to the center. Then line the cylindrical wall of the tube with a frictionless coating.
Then fill the tube back up with the dirt (and magma, etc.) that you originally removed.
What force is necessary at the bottom of the tube of dirt (that is, at the center of the
earth) to hold it up? Let the earth’s radius be R, and assume (incorrectly) a uniform
mass density ρ.

Solution: The gravitational force on a mass dm at radius r is effectively due to the
mass inside the radius r (call this Mr). The mass outside r is effectively not there.
The gravitational force is therefore

which we see increases linearly with r. The dirt in the tube between r and r + dr has
volume A dr, so its mass is dm = ρA dr. The total gravitational force on the entire
tube is therefore

The force at the bottom of the tube must be equal and opposite to this force. In terms
of the mass of the earth, ME = (4/3)πR3ρ, and the total mass of the tube, Mt = ρAR,
this result can be written as F = GMEMt/2R2. So the required force is half of what
a scale on the surface of the earth would read if all of the tube’s dirt sat in a lump on
top of it. The reason for this is basically that the force in Eq. (5.44) is linear in r.

An important subtopic of gravity is the tidal force, but because this is most
easily discussed in the context of accelerating frames of reference and fictitious
forces, we’ll postpone it until Chapter 10.

5.4.2 The Cavendish experiment

How do we determine the numerical value of G in Eq. (5.37)? If we can produce
a setup in which we know the values F, M, m, and r, then we can determine G.

5.4 Gravity

155

The first strategy that comes to mind is to take advantage of the fact that the
gravitational force on an object on the earth’s surface is known to be F = mg.
Combining this with Eq. (5.37) gives g = GME/R2. We know the values of g
and R,10 so this tells us what the product GME is. However, this information
unfortunately doesn’t help us, because we don’t know what the mass of the earth
is (without knowing G first, which we’re assuming we don’t know yet; see the last
paragraph in this section). For all we know, the mass of the earth might be 10 times
larger than what we think it is, with G being 10 times smaller. The only way to
find G is to use a setup with two known masses. But this then presents the problem
that the resulting force is extremely small. So the task boils down to figuring out
a way to measure the tiny force between two known masses. Henry Cavendish
solved this problem in 1798 by performing an extremely delicate experiment
(which was devised a few years earlier by John Michell, but he died before being
able to perform it).11 The basic idea behind the experiment is the following.

Consider the setup in Fig. 5.10, which shows the top view. A dumbbell with
two masses m on its ends hangs from a very thin wire. The dumbbell is free to twist,
although if it twists, the wire will provide a tiny restoring torque.12 The dumbbell
starts with no twist in the wire, and then two other masses M are placed (fixed)
at the positions shown. These masses produce attractive forces on the dumbbell
masses and cause the dumbbell to twist counterclockwise. The dumbbell will
oscillate back and forth before finally settling down at some tiny angle θ away
from the initial position.

The torque on the dumbbell that arises from the twist in the wire takes the
form of τ = −bθ (with counterclockwise torque taken to be positive), where b
is a constant that depends on the thickness and makeup of the wire. This linear
relation between τ and θ holds for small θ for all the same reasons that the
F = −kx Hooke’s-law result in Section 5.2 holds.

The gravitational force between each pair of masses is GMm/d2, where d
is the separation between the centers of the masses in each pair. So the torque
on the dumbbell due to the two gravitational forces is 2(GMm/d2)(cid:2), where (cid:2) is
half the length of the dumbbell. Demanding that the total torque on the dumb-
bell be zero gives

2GMm(cid:2)
d2

− bθ = 0 =⇒ G = bθd2
2Mm(cid:2) .

(5.46)

10 The radius of the earth has been known (at least roughly) since the time of Eratosthenes, about

250 BC. For an interesting way to measure it yourself, see Rawlins (1979).

11 The purpose of the experiment, as intended by Michell and Cavendish, was actually to measure
the density of the earth, and not G; see Clotfelter (1987). But as we’ll see below, this is equivalent
to measuring G.

12 We won’t talk about torque until Chapter 8, so you may want to come back and read this section
after that. We’ll invoke some results about rotational dynamics here, but the general setup should
be clear even if you’re not familiar with rotations.

Conservation of energy and momentum

We know all the parameters on the right-hand side except b, so if we can determine
that, then we’re done. It’s very difficult to measure b directly with any reasonable
accuracy, because the torque in the wire is so tiny. But fortunately there’s a sneaky
way to determine b that involves taking a page from our playbook on oscillations.
The bread-and-butter equation for rotations is τ = I ¨θ, where I is the moment of
inertia (which we can calculate for the dumbbell); this is the rotational analog of
Newton’s second law, F = m¨x. Now, if the torque takes the form of τ = −bθ
for small θ, then τ = I ¨θ becomes −bθ = I ¨θ. This is a good old simple-
harmonic-oscillator equation, so we know that the frequency of the oscillations
is ω =
b/I . Therefore, all we need to do is measure the period, T = 2π/ω,
of the oscillations while the dumbbell is settling down, and we can determine b
from b = I ω2 = I (2π/T )2. (The time T is large, because b is small on the scale
of things, because otherwise there wouldn’t be any noticeable twist in the wire.)
Plugging this value of b into Eq. (5.46) finally gives

(cid:4)

G = 4π 2I θd2
2Mm(cid:2)T 2 .

(5.47)

The Cavendish experiment is also known as the “weighing the earth” (or
perhaps the “massing the earth”) experiment, because now that we know G (and
also g and R), we can use g = GME/R2 to calculate the mass of the earth, ME. The
only possible way to determine ME (without examining every cubic meter of the
inside of the earth, which is obviously impossible) is to determine G first, as we
have done.13 Interestingly, the resulting value of ME, which is roughly 6·1024 kg,
leads to an average density of the earth of about 5.5 g/cm3. This is larger than
the density of the earth’s crust and mantle, so we conclude that there must be
something very dense deep down inside the earth. So the Cavendish experiment,
which involves masses hanging from a wire, amazingly tells us something about
the earth’s core!14

5.5 Momentum

5.5.1 Conservation of momentum

Newton’s third law says that for every force there is an equal and opposite force.
In other words, if Fab is the force that particle a feels due to particle b, and if
Fba is the force that particle b feels due to particle a, then Fba = −Fab at all
times. This law has important implications concerning momentum, p ≡ mv.
Consider two particles that interact over a period of time. Assume that they are
isolated from outside forces. From Newton’s second law, F = dp/dt, we see by
integrating this that the total change in a particle’s momentum equals the time

13 If you want to determine ME without using g or R (but still using G, of course, because ME appears

only through the combination GME), see Celnikier (1983).

14 For a comprehensive discussion of the earth’s core, see Brush (1980).

p(t2) − p(t1) =

This integral is called the impulse. If we now invoke the third law, Fba = −Fab,

Therefore,

pa(t2) + pb(t2) = pa(t1) + pb(t1).

(5.50)

This is the statement that the total momentum of this isolated system of two
particles is conserved; it does not depend on time. Note that Eq. (5.50) is a vector
equation, so it is really three equations, namely conservation of px, py, and pz.

Remark: Newton’s third law makes a statement about forces. But force is related to momentum
via F = dp/dt. So the third law essentially postulates conservation of momentum. (The “proof”
above in Eq. (5.49) is hardly a proof. It involves one simple integration.) So you might wonder
if momentum conservation is something you can prove, or if it’s something you have to assume,
as we have basically done because we have simply accepted the third law.

The difference between a postulate and a theorem is rather nebulous. One person’s postulate
might be another person’s theorem, and vice versa. You have to start somewhere in your
assumptions. We chose to start with the third law. In the Lagrangian formalism in Chapter 6,
the starting point is different, and momentum conservation is deduced as a consequence of
translational invariance (as we will see). So it looks more like a theorem in that formalism.

But one thing is certain. Momentum conservation for two particles cannot be proved from
scratch for arbitrary forces, because it is not necessarily true. For example, if two charged
particles interact in a certain way through the magnetic fields they produce, then the total
momentum of the two particles might not be conserved. Where is the missing momentum? It is
carried off in the electromagnetic field. The total momentum of the system is indeed conserved,
but the crucial point is that the system consists of the two particles plus the electromagnetic
field. Said in another way, each particle actually interacts with the electromagnetic field, and
not the other particle. Newton’s third law does not necessarily hold for particles subject to such
a force. ♣

Let’s now look at momentum conservation for a system of many particles.
As above, let Fij be the force that particle i feels due to particle j. Then Fij = −Fji
at all times. Assume that the particles are isolated from outside forces. The change
in momentum of the ith particle from t1 to t2 is (we won’t bother writing all the
t’s in the expressions below)

(cid:14) (cid:2) (cid:19)

Therefore, the change in the total momentum of all the particles is (switching the
order of the integration and the sum over i on the right-hand side here)

But
and Fab + Fba = 0 (and also, Faa = 0). The forces all cancel in pairs. Therefore,
the total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.

Example (Snow on a sled): You are riding on a sled that is given an initial push
and slides across frictionless ice. Snow is falling vertically (in the frame of the ice) on
the sled. Assume that the sled travels in tracks that constrain it to move in a straight
line. Which of the following three strategies causes the sled to move the fastest? The
slowest?

A: You sweep the snow off the sled so that it leaves the sled in the direction
perpendicular to the sled’s tracks, as seen by you in the frame of the sled.
B: You sweep the snow off the sled so that it leaves the sled in the direction
perpendicular to the sled’s tracks, as seen by someone in the frame of the ice.

C: You do nothing.

First solution: The sideways motion of the snow after you sweep it off is irrelevant,
because although Newton’s third law says that the swept snow applies a sideways force
on the sled, the normal force from the tracks keeps the sled from sliding off the tracks.
Also, the vertical motion of the snow when it hits the sled is irrelevant, because the
vertical normal force from the tracks keeps the sled from falling through the ground.
We are therefore concerned only with the motion in the direction of the tracks. And
since there are no external forces in this direction on the you/sled/snow system, the
momentum in this direction is conserved.

In general, the speed of the sled can (possibly) change due to two kinds of events:
(1) new snow hitting the sled (and eventually coming to rest with respect to the sled),
and (2) snow being swept off the sled.

Let’s first compare A with C. In strategy A, your sweeping action doesn’t change
the speed of the sled, because you are sweeping the snow directly sideways in your
frame. Since the sideways motion of the snow is irrelevant as far as the forward
momentum goes, you are essentially just reaching out and plopping a ball of snow
on the ice. This snow then simply travels along next to the sled at the same speed;
it might as well be connected to the sled (at least for a moment, until new snow hits
the sled). In strategy C, your (non) action obviously don’t change the speed of the
sled. So in comparing A with C, the departure of snow doesn’t differentiate them. We
therefore need only consider what happens to the sled when new snow hits it. But
this is easy to do: Since the sled is heavier in C than in A, a new snowflake slows it
down less in C than in A. Therefore, C is faster than A.

Now let’s compare B with C. B is faster than C because in B the snowflakes
have zero forward momentum in the end, whereas in C they have nonzero forward
momentum (because they are sitting on the moving sled). The momenta of the two
systems must be the same (equal to the initial momentum of the sled plus you), so
the sled must be moving faster in B.

Therefore, B is faster than C, which is faster than A. As a consistency check, it’s
easy to see that B is faster than A, because in B you must push the snow backward with

5.5 Momentum

159

respect to the sled. So by Newton’s third law, the swept snow in B exerts a forward
force on the sled.
In the end, this solution is basically the same as the first one, but
Second solution:
it’s a slightly more systematic way of looking at things: In B, all the snow is moving
slower than the sled; in fact, it is all at rest (at least in the forward direction) with
respect to the ice. In C, all the snow is on the sled. And in A, all the snow is moving
faster than the sled; it is moving along with various forward speeds, ranging from the
initial speed of the sled down to the present speed, depending on when it was swept off.
By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the sled (including you)
plus the snow at any given time is the same in all three cases. The only consistent
way to combine the facts in the previous paragraph with conservation of momentum
is for the speed of the sled to satisfy B > C > A. This is true because if someone
claimed that C > B, then the slowest object (namely everything, since all the snow
is on the sled) in C would be going faster than the fastest object (the sled) in B; this
would contradict the fact that the momenta of the two systems are equal. Therefore,
we must have B > C. Likewise, if someone claimed that A > C, then the slowest
object (the sled) in A would be going faster than the fastest object (everything) in C;
this would again be a contradiction. Therefore, we must have C > A. Putting these
together gives B > C > A. See Exercise 5.70 for a quantitative treatment of this setup.

5.5.2 Rocket motion

The quantitative application of momentum conservation can get a little tricky
when the mass m is allowed to vary. Such is the case with rockets, because most
of their mass consists of fuel which is eventually ejected.

Let mass be ejected backward with (constant) speed u relative to the rocket.15
Since u is a speed here, it is defined to be positive. This means that the velocity of
the ejected particles is obtained by subtracting u from the velocity of the rocket.
Let the rocket have initial mass M, and let m be the (changing) mass at a later
time. Then the rate of change of the rocket’s mass is dm/dt, which is negative.
So mass is ejected at a rate |dm/dt| = −dm/dt, which is positive. In other words,
during a small time dt, a negative mass dm gets added to the rocket, and a positive
mass (−dm) gets shot out the back. (If you wanted, you could define dm to be
positive, and then subtract it from the rocket’s mass, and have dm get shot out the
back. Either way is fine.) It may sound silly, but the hardest thing about rocket
motion is picking a sign for these quantities and sticking with it.

Consider a moment when the rocket has mass m and speed v. Then at a time
dt later (see Fig. 5.11), the rocket has mass m + dm and speed v + dv, while the

15 Just to emphasize, u is the speed with respect to the rocket. It wouldn’t make sense to say “relative
to the ground,” because the rocket’s engine shoots out the matter relative to itself, and the engine
has no way of knowing how fast the rocket is moving with respect to the ground.

exhaust has mass (−dm) and speed v − u (which may be positive or negative,
depending on the relative sizes of v and u). There are no external forces, so the
total momentum at each of these times must be equal. Therefore,

mv = (m + dm)(v + dv) + (−dm)(v − u).

(5.53)

Ignoring the second-order term dm dv, this simplifies to m dv = −u dm. Dividing
by m and integrating from t1 to t2 gives

(5.54)

For the case where the initial mass is M and the initial speed is 0, we have
v = u ln(M/m). Note that we haven’t assumed anything about dm/dt in this
derivation. There is no need for it to be constant; it can change in any way it
wants. The only thing that matters (assuming that M and u are given) is the final
mass m. In the special case where dm/dt happens to be constant (call it −η, where
η is positive), we have v(t) = u ln[M/(M − ηt)].

The log in the result in Eq. (5.54) is not very encouraging. If the mass of
the metal in the rocket is m, and if the mass of the fuel is 9m, then the final
speed is only u ln 10 ≈ (2.3)u. If the mass of the fuel is increased by a factor
of 11 up to 99m (which is probably not even structurally possible, given the
amount of metal required to hold it),16 then the final speed only doubles to
u ln 100 = 2(u ln 10) ≈ (4.6)u. How do you make a rocket go significantly
faster? Exercise 5.69 deals with this question.

Remark:
If you want, you can solve this rocket problem by using force instead of conservation
of momentum. If a chunk of mass (−dm) is ejected out the back, then its momentum changes
by u dm (which is negative). Therefore, because force equals the rate of change in momentum,
the force on this chunk is u dm/dt. By Newton’s third law, the remaining part of the rocket then
feels a force of −u dm/dt (which is positive). This force accelerates the remaining part of the
rocket, so F = ma gives −u dm/dt = m dv/dt,17 which is equivalent to the m dv = −u dm
result above.

We see that this rocket problem can be solved by using either force or conservation of
momentum. In the end, these two strategies are really the same, because the latter was derived
from F = dp/dt. But the philosophies behind the approaches are somewhat different. The
choice of strategy depends on personal preference. In an isolated system such as a rocket,
conservation of momentum is usually simpler. But in a problem involving an external force,
you have to use F = dp/dt. You’ll get lots of practice with F = dp/dt in the problems for this
section and also in Section 5.8. Note that we used both F = dp/dt and F = ma in this second
solution to the rocket problem. For further discussion of which expression to use in a given
situation, see Appendix C. ♣

16 The space shuttle’s external fuel tank, just by itself, has a fuel-to-container mass ratio of only

about 20.

17 Whether we use m or m + dm here for the mass of the rocket doesn’t matter. Any differences are

of second order.

5.6 The center of mass frame

161

5.6 The center of mass frame

5.6.1 Deﬁnition

When talking about momentum, it is understood that a certain frame of reference
has been chosen. After all, the velocities of the particles have to be measured
with respect to some coordinate system. Any inertial (that is, nonaccelerating)
frame is legal to pick, but we will see that there is one particular reference frame
that is often advantageous to use.

Consider a frame S and another frame S(cid:16) that moves at constant velocity u
with respect to S (see Fig. 5.12). Given a system of particles, the velocity of the
ith particle in S is related to its velocity in S(cid:16) by

y

vi = v

(cid:16)
i

+ u.

(5.55)

S

This relation implies that if momentum is conserved during a collision in frame
S(cid:16), then it is also conserved in frame S. This is true because both the initial and
final momenta of the system in S are increased by the same amount, (
mi)u,
compared with what they are in S(cid:16).18

(cid:26)

Let us therefore consider the unique frame in which the total momentum of a
system of particles is zero. This is called the center of mass frame, or CM frame.
If the total momentum is P ≡
mivi in frame S, then the CM frame is the frame
S(cid:16) that moves with velocity

(5.57)

The CM frame is extremely useful. Physical processes are generally much more
symmetrical in this frame, and this makes the results more transparent. The CM
frame is sometimes called the “zero momentum” frame. But the “center of mass”
name is commonly used because the center of mass of the particles doesn’t move
in the CM frame, for the following reason. The position of the center of mass is
defined by

RCM ≡

(cid:26)

miri
M

.

(5.58)

18 Alternatively, nowhere in our earlier derivation of momentum conservation did we say what frame
we were using. We assumed only that the frame wasn’t accelerating. If it were accelerating, then
F would not equal ma. We will see in Chapter 10 how F = ma is modified in a noninertial frame.
But there’s no need to worry about that here.

162

Conservation of energy and momentum

This is the location of the pivot upon which a rigid system would balance, as
we’ll see in Chapter 8. The fact that the CM doesn’t move with respect to the CM
frame follows from the fact that the derivative of RCM is the velocity of the CM
frame in Eq. (5.56). The center of mass may therefore be chosen as the origin of
the CM frame.

If we take two derivatives of Eq. (5.58), we obtain

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

M aCM ≡

miai =

Fi = Ftotal.

(5.59)

vm

M

Fig. 5.13

So as far as the acceleration of the CM goes, we can treat the system of particles
like a point mass at the CM, and then just apply F = ma to this point mass. Since
the internal forces cancel in pairs, we need only consider the external forces when
calculating Ftotal.

Along with the CM frame, the other frame that people generally work with
is the lab frame. There is nothing at all special about this frame. It is simply
the frame (assumed to be inertial) in which the conditions of the problem are
given. Any inertial frame can be called the “lab frame.” Solving problems often
involves switching back and forth between the lab and CM frames. For example,
if the final answer is requested in the lab frame, then you may want to transform
the given information from the lab frame to the CM frame where things are more
obvious, and then transform back to the lab frame to give the answer.

Example (Two masses in 1-D): A mass m with speed v approaches a stationary
mass M (see Fig. 5.13). The masses bounce off each other without any loss in total
energy. What are the final velocities of the particles? Assume that the motion takes
place in 1-D.

Solution: Doing this problem in the lab frame would require a potentially messy
use of conservation of energy (see the example in Section 5.7.1). But if we work in
the CM frame, things are much easier. The total momentum in the lab frame is mv,
so the CM frame moves to the right with speed mv/(m + M ) ≡ u with respect to the
lab frame. Therefore, in the CM frame, the velocities of the two masses are

vm = v − u = M v
m + M

,

and

vM = 0 − u = − mv
m + M

.

(5.60)

As a double-check, the difference in the velocities is v, and the ratio of the speeds is
M /m, which makes the total momentum zero.

The important point to realize now is that in the CM frame, the two particles must
simply reverse their velocities after the collision (assuming that they do indeed hit
each other). This is true because the speeds must still be in the ratio M/m after the
collision, in order for the total momentum to remain zero. Therefore, the speeds must
either both increase or both decrease. But if they do either of these, then energy is not
conserved.19

19 So we did have to use conservation of energy in this CM-frame solution. But it was far less messy

than it would have been in the lab frame.

5.6 The center of mass frame

163

If we now go back to the lab frame by adding the CM velocity of mv/(m + M )
to the two new velocities of −M v/(m + M ) and mv/(m + M ), we obtain final lab
velocities of

vm =

(m − M )v
m + M

,

and

vM = 2mv
m + M

.

(5.61)

If m = M , then the left mass stops, and the right mass picks up a velocity of v
Remark:
(this should be familiar to pool players). If M (cid:6) m, then the left mass bounces back with
velocity ≈ −v, and the right mass hardly moves (it’s essentially a brick wall). If m (cid:6) M ,
then the left mass keeps plowing along with velocity ≈ v, and the right mass picks up a
velocity of ≈ 2v. This 2v is an interesting result (it is clearer if you consider things in the
frame of the heavy mass m, which is essentially the CM frame), and it leads to some neat
effects, such as in Problem 5.23. ♣

5.6.2 Kinetic energy

Given a system of particles, the relation between the total kinetic energy in two
different frames is not very enlightening in general. But if one of the frames is
the CM frame, then the relation turns out to be quite nice. Let S(cid:16) be the CM
frame, which moves at constant velocity u with respect to another frame S. Then
the velocities of the particles in the two frames are related by vi = v(cid:16)
+ u. The

where M is the total mass of the system, and where we have used
by definition of the CM frame. Therefore, the K in any frame equals the K in the
CM frame, plus the K of the whole system treated like a point mass M located
at the CM, which moves with velocity u. An immediate corollary of this fact is
that if the K is conserved in a collision in one frame (which implies that KCM
is conserved, because conservation of momentum says that the CM speed u is
the same before and after the collision), then it is conserved in any other frame
(because again, the u relevant to that frame is the same before and after the
collision).

Conservation of energy and momentum

5.7 Collisions

There are two basic types of collisions among particles, namely elastic ones (in
which kinetic energy is conserved), and inelastic ones (in which kinetic energy
is lost). In any collision, the total energy is conserved, but in inelastic collisions
some of this energy goes into the form of heat (that is, relative motion of the
molecules inside the particles) instead of showing up in the net translational
motion of the particles.20

We’ll deal mainly with elastic collisions here, although some situations are
inherently inelastic, as we’ll see in Section 5.8. For inelastic collisions where
it is stated that a certain fraction, say 20%, of the kinetic energy is lost, only a
trivial modification to the procedure is required. To solve any elastic collision
problem, we just have to write down the conservation of energy and momentum
equations, and then solve for whatever variables we want to find.

5.7.1 One-dimensional motion

Let’s first look at one-dimensional motion. To see the general procedure, we’ll
solve the example from Section 5.6.1 again.

Example (Two masses in 1-D, again): A mass m with speed v approaches a
stationary mass M (see Fig. 5.14). The masses bounce off each other elastically. What
are the final velocities of the particles? Assume that the motion takes place in 1-D.

Solution: Let vf and Vf be the final velocities of the masses. Then conservation
of momentum and energy give, respectively,

mv + 0 = mvf + MVf ,

mv2 + 0 = 1

We must solve these two equations for the two unknowns vf and Vf . Solving for Vf
in the first equation and substituting into the second gives

(5.65)

One solution is vf = v, but this isn’t the one we’re concerned with. It is of course
a solution, because the initial conditions certainly satisfy conservation of energy and

20 We’ll use the terminology where “kinetic energy” refers to the overall translational energy of a
particle. That is, we’ll exclude heat from this definition, even though heat is just the relative kinetic
energy of molecules inside a particle.

momentum with the initial conditions (a fine tautology indeed). If you want, you can
view vf = v as the solution where the particles miss each other. The fact that vf = v
is always a root can often save you a lot of quadratic-formula trouble.

The vf = v(m − M )/(m + M ) root is the one we want. Plugging this vf back into

the first of Eqs. (5.64) to obtain Vf gives

vf =

(m − M )v
m + M

and Vf = 2mv
m + M

,

(5.66)

in agreement with Eq. (5.61).

This solution was somewhat of a pain, because it involved a quadratic
equation. The following theorem is extremely useful because it offers a way to
avoid the hassle of quadratic equations when dealing with 1-D elastic collisions.

Theorem 5.3 In a 1-D elastic collision, the relative velocity of the two particles
after the collision is the negative of the relative velocity before the collision.

Proof: Let the masses be m and M . Let vi and Vi be the initial velocities, and
let vf and Vf be the final velocities. Conservation of momentum and energy give

(5.68)

Dividing the second equation by the first gives vi + vf = Vi + Vf . Therefore,

vi − Vi = −(vf − Vf ),

(5.69)

as we wanted to show. In taking the quotient of these two equations, we have lost
the vf = vi and Vf = Vi solution. But as stated in the above example, this is the
(cid:1)
trivial solution.

This is a splendid theorem. It has the quadratic energy-conservation statement
built into it. Hence, using this theorem along with momentum conservation (both
of which are linear equations and thus easy to deal with) gives the same infor-
mation as the standard combination of Eqs. (5.67). Another quick proof is the
following. It is fairly easy to see that the theorem is true in the CM frame (as
we argued in the example in Section 5.6.1), so it is therefore true in any frame,
because it involves only differences in velocities.

5.7.2 Two-dimensional motion

Let’s now look at the more general case of two-dimensional motion. Three-
dimensional motion is just more of the same, so we’ll confine ourselves to 2-D.
Everything is basically the same as in 1-D, except that there is one more momen-
tum equation, and one more variable to solve for. This is best seen through an
example.

Example (Billiards): Abilliard ball with speed v approaches an identical stationary
one. The balls bounce off each other elastically, in such a way that the incoming one
gets deflected by an angle θ (see Fig. 5.15). What are the final speeds of the balls?
What is the angle φ at which the stationary ball is deflected?

Solution: Let vf and Vf be the final speeds of the balls. Then conservation of px,
py, and E give, respectively,

mv = mvf cos θ + mVf cos φ,
0 = mvf sin θ − mVf sin φ,
+ 1

mv2 = 1

(5.70)

We must solve these three equations for the three unknowns vf , Vf , and φ. There are
various ways to do this. Here’s one. Eliminate φ by adding the squares of the first
two equations (after putting the vf terms on the left-hand side) to obtain

v2 − 2vvf cos θ + v2
f

= V 2
f .

Now eliminate Vf by combining this with the third equation to obtain21

The third equation then yields

vf = v cos θ.

Vf = v sin θ.

(5.71)

(5.72)

(5.73)

The second equation then gives m(v cos θ) sin θ = m(v sin θ) sin φ, which implies
cos θ = sin φ (or θ = 0, which corresponds to no collision). Therefore,

φ = 90

◦ − θ.

(5.74)

In other words, the balls bounce off at right angles with respect to each other. This
fact is well known to pool players. Problem 5.19 gives another (cleaner) way to
demonstrate this result. Note that we needed to specify one of the four quantities, vf ,
Vf , θ , φ (we chose θ ), because we have only three equations. Intuitively, we can’t
expect to solve for all four of these quantities, because we can imagine one ball hitting

21 Another solution is vf = 0. In this case, φ must equal zero, and θ is not well defined. This is

simply the 1-D motion in the example in Section 5.6.1.

5.8 Inherently inelastic processes

167

the other at various distances away from directly head-on, which will cause the balls
to be deflected at various angles.

As we saw in the 1-D example in Section 5.6.1, collisions are often much
easier to deal with in the CM frame. Using the same reasoning (conservation
of p and E) that we used in that example, we conclude that in 2-D (or 3-D) the
final speeds of two elastically colliding particles must be the same as the initial
speeds. The only degree of freedom in the CM frame is the angle of the line
containing the final (oppositely directed) velocities. This simplicity in the CM
frame invariably provides for a cleaner solution than the lab frame yields. A good
example of this is Exercise 5.81, which gives yet another way to derive the above
right-angle billiard result.

5.8 Inherently inelastic processes

There is a nice class of problems where the system has inherently inelastic prop-
erties, even if it doesn’t appear so at first glance. In such a problem, no matter
how you try to set it up, there will be inevitable kinetic energy loss that shows
up in the form of heat. Total energy is conserved, of course, since heat is simply
another form of energy. But the point is that if you try to write down a bunch of
(1/2)mv2’s and conserve their sum, then you’re going to get the wrong answer.
The following example is the classic illustration of this type of problem.

Example (Sand on conveyor belt): Sand drops vertically (from a negligible
height) at a rate σ kg/s onto a moving conveyor belt.

(a) What force must you apply to the belt in order to keep it moving at a constant

speed v?

(b) How much kinetic energy does the sand gain per unit time?
(c) How much work do you do per unit time?
(d) How much energy is lost to heat per unit time?

Solution:

(a) Your force equals the rate of change in momentum. If we let m be the combined

mass of the conveyor belt plus the sand on the belt, then
= d(mv)

F = dp

where we have used the fact that v is constant.

(c) The work done by your force per unit time is

d(Work)

= Fv = σ v2,

(5.77)

where we have used Eq. (5.75).

(d) If work is done at a rate σ v2, and kinetic energy is gained at a rate σ v2/2, then
the “missing” energy must be lost to heat at a rate σ v2 − σ v2/2 = σ v2/2.

In this example, it turned out that exactly the same amount of energy was lost
to heat as was converted into kinetic energy of the sand. There is an interesting
and simple way to see why this is true. In the following explanation, we’ll just
deal with one particle of mass M that falls onto the conveyor belt, for simplicity.
In the lab frame, the mass gains a kinetic energy of M v2/2 by the time it
finally comes to rest with respect to the belt, because the belt moves at speed v.
Now look at things in the conveyor belt’s reference frame. In this frame, the mass
comes flying in with an initial kinetic energy of M v2/2, and then it eventually
slows down and comes to rest on the belt. Therefore, all of the M v2/2 energy
is converted to heat. And since the heat is the same in both frames, this is the
amount of heat in the lab frame, too.

We therefore see that in the lab frame, the equality of the heat loss and the
gain in kinetic energy is a consequence of the obvious fact that the belt moves at
the same rate with respect to the lab (namely v) as the lab moves with respect to
the belt (also v).

In the solution to the above example, we did not assume anything about the
nature of the friction force between the belt and the sand. The loss of energy
to heat is an unavoidable result. You might think that if the sand comes to rest
on the belt very “gently” (over a long period of time), then you can avoid the
heat loss. This is not the case. In that scenario, the smallness of the friction force
is compensated by the fact that the force must act over a very large distance.
Likewise, if the sand comes to rest on the belt very abruptly, then the largeness
of the friction force is compensated by the smallness of the distance over which
it acts. No matter how you set things up, the work done by the friction force is
the same nonzero quantity.

In other problems such as the following one, it is fairly clear that the process
is inelastic. But the challenge is to correctly use F = dp/dt instead of F = ma,
because F = ma will get you into trouble due to the changing mass.

Example (Chain on a scale): An “idealized” (see the comments following this
example) chain with length L and mass density σ kg/m is held such that it hangs
vertically just above a scale. It is then released. What is the reading on the scale, as a
function of the height of the top of the chain?

5.8 Inherently inelastic processes

169

First solution: Let y be the height of the top of the chain, and let F be the desired
force applied by the scale. The net force on the entire chain is F −(σ L)g, with upward
taken to be positive. The momentum of the entire chain (which just comes from the
moving part) is (σ y)˙y. Note that this is negative, because ˙y is negative. Equating the
net force on the entire chain with the rate of change in its momentum gives

F − σ Lg = d(σ y˙y)

dt
= σ y¨y + σ ˙y2.

(5.78)

The part of the chain that is still above the scale is in free fall. Therefore, ¨y = −g.
(cid:4)
And conservation of energy gives ˙y =
2g(L − y), because the chain has fallen a
distance L − y. Plugging these into Eq. (5.78) gives

F = σ Lg − σ yg + 2σ (L − y)g

= 3σ (L − y)g,

(5.79)

which happens to be three times the weight of the chain already on the scale. This
answer for F has the expected property of equaling zero when y = L, and also the
interesting property of equaling 3(σ L)g right before the last bit touches the scale.
Once the chain is completely on the scale, the reading suddenly drops down to the
weight of the chain, namely (σ L)g.

If you used conservation of energy to do this problem and assumed that all of the
lost potential energy goes into the kinetic energy of the moving part of the chain, then
you would obtain a speed of infinity for the last infinitesimal part of the chain to hit
the scale. This is certainly incorrect, and the reason is that there is inevitable heat loss
that arises when the pieces of the chain inelastically smash into the scale.

Second solution: The normal force from the scale is responsible for doing two
things. It holds up the part of the chain that already lies on the scale, and it also
changes the momentum of the atoms that are suddenly brought to rest when they hit
the scale. The first of these two parts of the force is simply the weight of the chain
already on the scale, which is Fweight = σ (L − y)g.

To find the second part of the force, we need to find the change in momentum, dp,
of the part of the chain that hits the scale during a given time dt. The amount of mass
that hits the scale in a time dt is dm = σ |dy| = σ |˙y| dt = −σ ˙y dt, since ˙y is negative.
This mass initially has velocity ˙y, and then it is abruptly brought to rest. Therefore,
the change in its momentum is dp = 0−(dm)˙y = σ ˙y2 dt, which is positive. The force
required to cause this change in momentum is

Fdp/dt = dp
dt
(cid:4)

= σ ˙y2.

(5.80)

But as in the first solution, we have ˙y =
the scale is

2g(L − y). Therefore, the total force from

F = Fweight + Fdp/dt = σ (L − y)g + 2σ (L − y)g

= 3σ (L − y)g.

(5.81)

170

Conservation of energy and momentum

Note that Fdp/dt = 2Fweight (until the chain is completely on the scale), independent
of y.

In this example, we assumed that the chain was “ideal,” in the sense that it was
completely flexible, infinitesimally thin, and unstretchable. The simplest model
that satisfies these criteria is a series of point masses connected by short massless
strings. But in the above example, the strings actually don’t even matter. You
could instead start with many little unconnected point masses held in a vertical
line, with the bottom one just above the scale. If you then dropped all of them
simultaneously, they would successively smash into the scale in the same manner
as if they were attached by little strings; the tension in the strings would all be
zero. However, even though the strings aren’t necessary in this chain and scale
example, there are many setups involving idealized chains where they are in fact
necessary, because a tension is required in them. This is evident in many of the
problems and exercises for this chapter, as you will see.

An interesting fact

is that even with the above definition of an ideal
chain,
there are some setups (in contrast with the one above) for which it
is impossible to specify how the system behaves, without being given more
information. This information involves the relative size of two specific length
scales, as we’ll see below. To illustrate this, consider the two following
scenarios for the setup in Problem 5.28 (see Fig. 5.16), where a vertical
ideal chain is dropped with its bottom end attached to the underneath of a
support.

• First scenario (energy nonconserving): Let the spacing between the point masses in
our ideal chain be large compared with the horizontal span of the bend in the chain at
its bottom; see Fig. 5.17. Then the system is for all practical purposes one dimensional.
Each of the masses stops abruptly when it reaches the bend. This stoppage is a completely
inelastic collision in the same way it was in the above example with the chain falling on
the scale. Note that at any point in time, the bend consists of a massless piece of string
folded back along itself (or perhaps it consists of one of the masses, if we happen to be
looking at it right when a mass stops). There is no tension in this bottom piece of string
(if there were, then the massless bend would have an infinite acceleration upward), so
there is no tension pulling down the part of the chain on the left side of the bend. The
left part of the chain is therefore in freefall.

• Second scenario (energy conserving): Let the spacing between the point masses in
our ideal chain be small compared with the horizontal span of the bend in the chain
at its bottom; see Fig. 5.18. The system is now inherently two dimensional, and the
masses are essentially continuously distributed along the chain, as far as the bend is
concerned. This has the effect of allowing each mass to gradually come to rest, so
there is no abrupt inelastic stopping like there was in the first scenario. Each mass

in the bend keeps the same distance from its two neighbors, whereas in the first sce-
nario the mass that has just stopped soon sees the next mass fly directly past it before
abruptly coming to rest. The process in this second scenario is elastic; no energy is lost
to heat.

The basic difference between the two scenarios is whether or not there is slack
in any of the strings in the bend. If there is, then the relative speed between a pair
of masses changes abruptly at some point, which means that the relative kinetic
energy of the masses goes into damped (perhaps very overdamped) vibrational
motion in the connecting string, which then decays into the random motion
of heat.22

If no energy is lost to heat in the second scenario, then you might think that the
last infinitesimal piece of the chain will have an infinite speed. However, there
isn’t one last piece of the chain. When the left part of the chain has disappeared
and we are left with only the bend and the right part, the small (but nonzero)
bend is the last “piece,” and it ends up swinging horizontally with a large speed.
This then drags the whole chain to the side in a very visible motion (which can
be traced to the horizontal force from the support), at which point we have a very
noticeably two-dimensional system. The initial potential energy of the chain ends
up as kinetic energy of the final wavy side-to-side motion.

A consequence of energy conservation in the second scenario is that for a given
height fallen, the left part of the chain will be moving faster than the left part in
the first scenario. In other words, the left part in the second scenario accelerates
downward faster than the freefall g. But although this result follows quickly
from energy considerations, it isn’t so obvious in terms of a force argument.
Apparently there exists a tension at the left end of the bend in the second scenario
that drags down the left part of the chain to give it an acceleration greater than
g. A qualitative way of seeing why a tension exists there is the following. A tiny
piece of the chain that enters the bend from the left part slows down as it gradually
joins the fixed right part of the chain. There must therefore be an upward force on
this tiny piece. This upward force can’t occur at the bottom of the piece, because
any tension there pulls down on it. The force must therefore occur at the top of
the piece. In other words, there is a tension at this point, and so by Newton’s third
law this tension pulls down on the left part of the chain, thereby causing it to
accelerate faster than g. One of the tasks of Problem 5.29 is to find the tensions
at the two ends of the bend.

There is a simple way to demonstrate the existence of a tension that pulls
on the free part of the chain. The following setup is basically the falling-chain
setup without gravity, but it still has all the essential parts. Place a rope on a

22 If the strings were ideal springs with weak spring constants, then the energy would keep changing
back and forth between potential energy of the springs and kinetic energy of the masses, causing
the masses to bounce around and possibly run into each other. But we’re assuming that the strings
in our ideal chain are essentially very rigid overdamped springs.

172

Conservation of energy and momentum

(fairly smooth) table, in the shape of a very thin “U” so that it doubles back
along itself. Then quickly yank on one of the ends, in the direction away from
the bend. You will find that the other end moves backwards, in the direction
opposite to the motion of your hand, toward the bend (at least until the bend
reaches it and drags it forward). There must therefore exist a tension in the rope
to drag the other end backwards. But there’s no need to take my word for it – all
you need is a piece of rope. This effect is essentially the same as the one (in a
simplified version, since the rope here has constant density) that leads to the crack
of a whip.

Note that a perfectly flexible thin rope, with its continuous mass distribution,
does indeed behave elastically like the second scenario above. The continuous
rope may be thought of as a series of point masses with infinitesimal separa-
tion, and so this separation is much smaller than the small (but finite) length
of the bend. As long as the thickness of the rope is much smaller than the
length of the bend, every piece of the rope slows to a stop gradually in the
original falling-chain setup, or starts up from rest gradually in the preceding
“U” setup. So there is no heat loss in either setup from abrupt changes in
motion.

Returning to the falling-chain system with one of our ideal chains, you
might think that if the bend is made really small, so that the system looks one-
dimensional, then it should behave inelastically like the first scenario above.
However, the only relevant fact is whether the bend is smaller than the spacing
between the point masses in our ideal chain. The word “small” is meaningless,
of course, because we are talking about the length of the bend, which is a dimen-
sionful quantity. It makes sense only to use the word “smaller,” that is, to compare
one length with another. The other length here is the spacing between the masses.
If the length of the bend is large compared with this spacing, then no matter what
the actual length of the bend is, the system behaves elastically like the second
scenario above.

So which of the two scenarios better describes a real chain? Details of an
actual experiment involving a falling chain are given in Calkin and March (1989).
The results show that a real chain behaves basically like the chain in the second
scenario above, at least until the final part of the motion. In other words, it is
energy conserving, and the left part accelerates faster than g. 23

Having said all this, it turns out that the energy-conserving second scenario
leads to complicated issues in problems (such as the numerical integration in
Problem 5.29), so for all the problems and exercises in this chapter (with the
exception of Problem 5.29), we’ll assume that we’re dealing with the inelastic
first scenario.

23 Spur-of-the-moment (but still plenty convincing) experiments were also performed by Wes

Campbell in the physics laboratory of John Doyle at Harvard.

Consider a cube of uniform mass density. Find the ratio of the gravita-
tional potential energy of a mass at a corner to that of the same mass

integrals.

5.13. Through the hole **

(a) A hole of radius R is cut out from an infinite flat sheet with mass
density σ per unit area. Let L be the line that is perpendicular to
the sheet and that passes through the center of the hole. What is
the force on a mass m that is located on L, at a distance x from the
center of the hole? Hint: Consider the plane to consist of many
concentric rings.

A snowball is thrown against a wall. Where does its momentum go?
Where does its energy go?

5.15. Propelling a car **

For some odd reason, you decide to throw baseballs at a car of mass
M that is free to move frictionlessly on the ground. You throw the
balls at the back of the car at speed u, and they leave your hand at a
mass rate of σ kg/s (assume the rate is continuous, for simplicity). If
the car starts at rest, find its speed and position as a function of time,
assuming that the balls bounce elastically directly backward off the back
window.

5.16. Propelling a car again **

Do the previous problem, except now assume that the back window is
open, so that the balls collect inside the car.

5.17. Leaky bucket **

At t = 0, a massless bucket contains a mass M of sand. It is connected to
a wall by a massless spring with constant tension T (that is, independent
of length).25 See Fig. 5.23. The ground is frictionless, and the initial
distance to the wall is L. At later times, let x be the distance from the
wall, and let m be the mass of sand in the bucket. The bucket is released,
and on its way to the wall, it leaks sand at a rate dm/dx = M/L. In other
words, the rate is constant with respect to distance, not time; and it ends
up empty right when it reaches the wall. Note that dx is negative, so dm
is also.

(a) What is the kinetic energy of the (sand in the) bucket, as a function

of x? What is its maximum value?

(b) What is the magnitude of the momentum of the bucket, as a

function of x? What is its maximum value?

5.18. Another leaky bucket ***

Consider the setup in Problem 5.17, but now let the sand leak at a rate
proportional to the bucket’s acceleration. That is, dm/dt = b¨x. Note that
¨x is negative, so dm is also.

25 You can construct a constant-tension spring with a regular Hooke’s-law spring in the following
way. Pick the spring constant to be very small, and stretch the spring a very large distance. Have
it pass through a hole in the wall, with its other end bolted down a large distance to the left of the
wall. Any changes in the bucket’s position will yield a negligible change in the spring force.

the conservation of momentum equation with itself.

5.20. Bouncing and recoiling **

A ball of mass m and initial speed v0 bounces back and forth between
a fixed wall and a block of mass M , with M (cid:6) m; see Fig. 5.24. The
block is initially at rest. Assume that the ball bounces elastically and
instantaneously. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block
and the ground is µ. There is no friction between the ball and the ground.
What is the speed of the ball after the nth bounce off the block? How far
does the block eventually move? How much total time does the block
actually spend in motion? Work in the approximation where M (cid:6) m,
and assume that the distance to the wall is large enough so that the block
comes to rest by the time the next bounce occurs.

5.21. Drag force on a sheet **

A sheet of mass M moves with speed V through a region of space
that contains particles of mass m and speed v. There are n of these
particles per unit volume. The sheet moves in the direction of its normal.
Assume m (cid:4) M , and assume that the particles do not interact with
each other.

(a) If v (cid:4) V , what is the drag force per unit area on the sheet?
(b) If v (cid:6) V , what is the drag force per unit area on the sheet?
Assume, for simplicity, that the component of every particle’s
velocity in the direction of the sheet’s motion is exactly ±v/2.26

5.22. Drag force on a cylinder **

A cylinder of mass M and radius R moves with speed V through a region
of space that contains particles of mass m that are at rest. There are n
of these particles per unit volume. The cylinder moves in a direction
perpendicular to its axis. Assume m (cid:4) M , and assume that the particles
do not interact with each other. What is the drag force per unit length on
the cylinder?

approximation where m1 is much larger than m2, and assume that
the balls bounce elastically. Also assume, for the sake of having
a nice clean problem, that the balls are initially separated by a
small distance, and that the balls bounce instantaneously.
(b) Now consider n balls, B1, . . . , Bn, having masses m1, m2, . . . , mn
(with m1 (cid:6) m2 (cid:6) · · · (cid:6) mn), standing in a vertical stack (see
Fig. 5.26). The bottom of B1 is a height h above the ground, and
the bottom of Bn is a height h + (cid:2) above the ground. The balls are
dropped. In terms of n, to what height does the top ball bounce?
Note: Make assumptions and approximations similar to the ones
in part (a).

If h = 1 meter, what is the minimum number of balls needed for
the top one to bounce to a height of at least 1 kilometer? To reach
escape velocity? Assume that the balls still bounce elastically
(which is a bit absurd here), and ignore wind resistance, etc., and
assume that (cid:2) is negligible.

5.24. Maximal deflection ***

A mass M collides with a stationary mass m. If M < m, then it is possi-
ble for M to bounce directly backward. However, if M > m, then there
is a maximal angle of deflection of M . Show that this maximal angle
equals sin−1(m/M ). Hint: It is possible to do this problem by working
in the lab frame, but you can save yourself a lot of time by consider-
ing what happens in the CM frame, and then shifting back to the lab
frame.

Section 5.8: Inherently inelastic processes

Note: In the problems involving chains in this section (with the exception
of Problem 5.29), we’ll assume that the chains are of the type described
in the first scenario near the end of Section 5.8.

5.25. Colliding masses *

A mass M , initially moving at speed V , collides and sticks to a mass m,
initially at rest. Assume M (cid:6) m, and work in this approximation. What
are the final energies of the two masses, and how much energy is lost to
heat, in:

(a) The lab frame?
(b) The frame in which M is initially at rest?

5.26. Pulling a chain **

A chain with length L and mass density σ kg/m lies straight on a friction-
less horizontal surface. You grab one end and pull it back along itself,
in a parallel manner (see Fig. 5.27). Assume that you pull it at constant

do, by the time the chain is straightened out? How much energy is lost
to heat, if any?

5.27. Pulling a chain again **

A chain with mass density σ kg/m lies in a heap on the floor. You
grab an end and pull horizontally with constant force F. What is the
position of the end of the chain, as a function of time, while it is unrav-
elling? Assume that the chain is greased, so that it has no friction with
itself.

5.28. Falling chain **

A chain with length L and mass density σ kg/m is held in the position
shown in Fig. 5.28, with one end attached to a support. Assume that
only a negligible length of the chain starts out below the support. The
chain is released. Find the force that the support applies to the chain, as
a function of time.

Consider the setup in the previous problem, but now let the chain be of
the type in the second scenario described in Section 5.8. Show that the
total time it takes the chain to straighten out is approximately 85% of
the time it would take if the left part were in freefall (as it was in the
previous problem); you will need to solve something numerically. Also,
show that the tension at the left end of the infinitesimal bend equals the
tension at the right end at all times.27

Fig. 5.28

5.30. Falling from a table ***

(a) A chain with length L lies in a straight line on a frictionless table,
except for a very small piece at one end which hangs down through
a hole in the table. This piece is released, and the chain slides down
through the hole. What is the speed of the chain at the instant it
loses contact with the table? (See Footnote 3.19.)

(b) Answer the same question, but now let the chain lie in a heap on a
table, except for a very small piece at one end which hangs down
through the hole. Assume that the chain is greased, so that it has
no friction with itself. Which of these two scenarios has the larger
final speed?

27 The “ends” of the bend actually aren’t well defined, because the chain is at least a little bit curved
everywhere. But since we’re assuming that the horizontal span of the chain is very small, we can
define the height of the bend to be, say, 100 times this horizontal span, and this height is still
negligible compared with the total height of the chain.

distributed, and at rest) in air, and consider a raindrop falling through

drop is initially of negligible size and that when it hits a water droplet,
the droplet’s water gets added to it. Also, assume that the raindrop is
spherical at all times.

5.32. Cart in a valley

A cart containing sand starts at rest and then rolls, without any energy
loss to friction, down into a valley and then up a hill on the other side.
Let the initial height be h1, and let the final height attained on the other
side be h2. If the cart leaks sand along the way, how does h2 compare
with h1?

5.33. Walking on an escalator

An escalator moves downward at constant speed. You walk up the esca-
lator at this same speed, so that you remain at rest with respect to the
ground. In the ground frame, are you doing any work?

5.34. Lots of work

If you push on a wall with your hand, you don’t do any work, because
your hand doesn’t move. But in the reference frame of a person moving
past you (from front to back), you do in fact do work, because your
hand moves. And since the person’s speed can be made arbitrarily large,
you can do an arbitrarily large amount of work in the person’s frame.
It therefore seems like you should quickly use up your dinner from the
night before and become very hungry. But you don’t. Why not?

5.35. Spring energy

Using the explicit form of the position of a mass on the end of a spring,
x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ), verify that the total energy is conserved.

5.36. Damping work *

A damped oscillator (with m¨x = −kx − b˙x) has initial position x0 and
speed v0. After a long time, it will essentially be at rest at the origin.
Therefore, by the work–energy theorem, the work done by the damping
force must equal −kx2

then calculate the desired integral. An easier way is to use the F = ma
equation to rewrite the ˙x in your integral.

5.37. Heading to infinity *

A particle moves under the influence of a potential V (x) = −A|x|n,
where A > 0 and n > 0. It starts at a positive value of x with a
velocity that points in the positive x direction. For what values of n
will the particle reach infinity in a finite time? You may assume that
E > 0, although this isn’t necessary. (You can compare this exercise with
Problem 5.2.)

5.38. Work in different frames *

An object, initially at rest, is subject to a force that gives it constant
acceleration a for time t. Verify explicitly that W = (cid:16)K in (a) the lab
frame, and (b) a frame moving to the left at speed V .

5.39. Roller coaster *

A roller coaster car starts at rest and coasts down a frictionless track.
It encounters a vertical loop of radius R. How much higher than the top
of the loop must the car start if it is to remain in contact with the track
at all times?

5.40. Pendulum and peg *

A pendulum of length L is held with its string horizontal, and then
released. The string runs into a peg a distance d below the pivot, as
shown in Fig. 5.29. What is the smallest value of d for which the string
remains taut at all times?

5.41. Circling around a cone *

A fixed hollow frictionless cone is positioned with its tip pointing down.
A particle is released from rest on the inside surface. After it has slid part
way down to the tip, it bounces elastically off a platform. The platform
is positioned at a 45◦ angle along the surface of the cone, so the particle
ends up being deflected horizontally along the surface (in other words,
into the page in Fig. 5.30). If the resulting motion of the particle is a
horizontal circle around the cone, what is the ratio of the initial height
of the particle to the height of the platform?

initially at its relaxed length. A mass m is then attached to the bottom
and is released.

the height y (which is negative), relative to the initial position.

(b) Find y0, the point at which the potential energy is minimum. Make

a rough plot of V (y).

(c) Rewrite the potential energy as a function of z ≡ y − y0. Explain
why your result shows that a hanging spring can be considered
to be a spring in a world without gravity, provided that the new
equilibrium point, y0, is now called the “relaxed” length of the
spring.

5.43. Removing the friction *

A block of mass m is supported by a spring on an inclined plane, as shown
in Fig. 5.31. The spring constant is k, the plane’s angle of inclination is
θ, and the coefficient of static friction between the block and the plane
is µ.

(a) You move the block down the plane, compressing the spring.
What is the maximum compression distance of the spring (relative
to the relaxed length it has when nothing is attached to it) that
allows the block to remain at rest when you let go of it?

(b) Assume that the block is at the maximum compression you found
in part (a). At a given instant, you somehow cause the plane to
become frictionless, and the block gets pushed up along the plane.
What must the relation between θ and the original µ be, so that
the block reaches its maximum height when the spring is at its
relaxed length?

5.44. Spring and friction **

A spring with spring constant k stands vertically, and a mass m is placed
on top of it. The mass is slowly lowered to its equilibrium position.
With the spring held at this compression length, the system is rotated to
a horizontal position. The left end of the spring is attached to a wall, and
the mass is placed on a table with a coefficient of friction (both kinetic
and static) of µ = 1/8; see Fig. 5.32. The mass is released.

(a) What is the initial compression of the spring?
(b) How much does the maximal stretch (or compression) of the

spring decrease after each half-oscillation?

(c) How many times does the mass oscillate back and forth before

coming to rest?

5.45. Keeping contact **

A frictionless circle of radius R is made out of a strip of metal and held
fixed in a vertical plane. A massless spring with spring constant k has one
end attached to the bottom point on the inside surface of the circle, and the
other end attached to a mass m. The spring is compressed to zero length,

with the mass touching the inside surface of the circle at the bottom.
(Whatever negligible length of spring remains is essentially horizontal.)
The spring is then released, and the mass gets pushed initially to the
right and then up along the circle; the setup at a random later time is
shown in Fig. 5.33. Let (cid:2) be the equilibrium length of the spring. What
is the minimum value of (cid:2) for which the mass remains in contact with
the circle at all times?

5.46. Spring and hoop **

A fixed hoop of radius R stands vertically. A spring with spring constant
k and relaxed length of zero is attached to the top of the hoop.

(a) A block of mass m is attached to the unstretched spring and
dropped from the top of the hoop. If the resulting motion of the
mass is a linear vertical oscillation between the top and bottom
points on the hoop, what is k?

(b) The block is now removed from the spring, and the spring is
stretched and connected to a bead, also of mass m, at the bottom
of the hoop, as shown in Fig. 5.34. The bead is constrained to
move along the hoop. It is given a rightward kick and acquires an
initial speed v0. Assuming that it moves frictionlessly, how does
its speed depend on its position along the hoop?

(x, y) = (0, 0), the wire is horizontal and the bead passes this point with
a given speed v0 to the right. What should the shape of the wire be (that
is, what is y as a function of x) so that the horizontal speed remains v0
at all times? One solution is simply y = 0. Find the other.28

pipe? Consider two cases: (a) the ball is allowed to touch the pipe, and
(b) the ball is not allowed to touch the pipe.

A mass is attached to one end of a massless string, the other end of which
is attached to a fixed support. The mass swings around in a vertical circle
as shown in Fig. 5.36. Assuming that the mass has the minimum speed
necessary at the top of the circle to keep the string from going slack, at
what location should you cut the string so that the resulting projectile
motion of the mass has its maximum height located directly above the
center of the circle?

5.51. Beads on a hoop **

Two beads of mass m are initially at rest at the top of a frictionless hoop
of mass M and radius R, which stands vertically on the ground. The
beads are given tiny kicks, and they slide down the hoop, one to the
right and one to the left, as shown in Fig. 5.37. What is the largest value
of m/M for which the hoop never rises up off the ground?

5.52. Stationary bowl ***

A hemispherical bowl of mass M rests on a table. The inside surface
of the bowl is frictionless, while the coefficient of friction between the
bottom of the bowl and the table is µ = 1. A particle of mass m is
released from rest at the top of the bowl and slides down into it, as
shown in Fig. 5.38. What is the largest value of m/M for which the
bowl never slides on the table? Hint: The angle you’re concerned with
is not 45◦.

5.53. Leaving the hemisphere ****

A point particle of mass m sits at rest on top of a frictionless hemisphere
of mass M , which rests on a frictionless table. The particle is given a
tiny kick and slides down the (recoiling) hemisphere. At what angle θ
(measured from the top of the hemisphere) does the particle lose contact
with the hemisphere? In answering this question for m (cid:13)= M , it is suf-
ficient for you to produce an equation that θ must satisfy (it’s a cubic).
However, for the special case of m = M , the equation can be solved
without too much difficulty; find the angle in this case.

5.54. Tetherball ****

A small ball is attached to a massless string of length L, the other end
of which is attached to a very thin pole. The ball is thrown so that it
initially travels in a horizontal circle, with the string making an angle
θ0 with the vertical. As time goes on, the string wraps itself around the

pole. Assume that (1) the pole is thin enough so that the length of string
in the air decreases very slowly, so that the ball’s motion may always be
approximated as a circle, and (2) the pole has enough friction so that the
string does not slide on the pole, once it touches it. Show that the ratio
of the ball’s final speed (right before it hits the pole) to initial speed is
vf /vi = sin θ0.

What is the minimum initial velocity (with respect to the earth) required
for an object to escape from the solar system?29 Take the orbital motion
of the earth into account (but ignore the rotation of the earth, and ignore
the other planets). You are free to choose (wisely) the firing direction.
Make the (good) approximation that the process occurs in two separate
steps: first the object escapes from the earth, and then it escapes from
the sun (starting at the radius of the earth’s orbit). Some useful quantities
are given in the solution to Problem 5.11; also, the orbital speed of the
earth is about 30 km/s. Hint: a common incorrect answer is 13.5 km/s.

speed be at the center of the shell? You can let R2 = 2R1 in this
part of the problem, to keep things from getting too messy. Give
your answer in terms of R ≡ R1.

5.62. Orbiting stick **

Consider a planet of mass M and radius R. A very long stick of length
2R extends from just above the surface of the planet out to a radius 3R.
If initial conditions have been set up so that the stick moves in a circular
orbit while always pointing radially (see Fig. 5.42), what is the period

of this orbit? How does this period compare with the period of a satellite
in a circular orbit of radius 2R?

5.63. Speedy travel **

A straight tube is drilled between two points on the earth, as shown
in Fig. 5.43. An object is dropped into the tube. What is the resulting
motion? How long does it take to reach the other end? Ignore friction,
and assume (incorrectly) that the density of the earth is constant (ρ =
5.5 g/cm3).

5.64. Mine shaft **

Fig. 5.43

(a) If the earth had constant density, the gravitational force would
decrease linearly with radius as you descend in a mine shaft; see
Eq. (5.44). However, the density of the earth is not constant, and
in fact the gravitational force increases as you descend. Show that
the general condition under which this is true is ρc < (2/3)ρavg,
where ρavg is the average density of the earth, and ρc is the density
of the crust at the surface. (The values for the earth are ρc ≈
3 g/cm3 and ρavg ≈ 5.5 g/cm3.) See Zaidins (1972).

(b) A similar problem to the one in part (a), which actually turns
out to be exactly the same, is the following. Consider a large
flat horizontal sheet of material with density ρ and thickness
x. Show that the gravitational force (from the earth plus the
sheet) just below the sheet is larger than the force just above it
if ρ < (2/3)ρavg, where ρavg is the average density of the earth.
A sheet of wood (with a density roughly equal to that of water)
satisfies this inequality, but a sheet of gold doesn’t. A result from
Problem 5.13 will be useful here.

(c) Assuming that the density of a planet is a function of radius only,
what should ρ(r) look like if you want the gravitational force to
be independent of the depth in a mine shaft, all the way down to
the center of the planet?

5.65. Space elevator **

(a) Let the earth’s radius be R, its average density be ρ, and its angular
frequency of rotation be ω. Show that if a satellite is to remain
above the same point on the equator at all times, then it must
travel in a circle of radius ηR, where

(b) Instead of a satellite, consider a long rope with uniform mass
density extending radially from just above the surface of the earth
out to a radius η(cid:16)R. 30 Show that if the rope is to remain above the
same point on the equator at all times, then η(cid:16) must be given by
η(cid:16)2 + η(cid:16) = 8πGρ

What is the numerical value of η(cid:16)? Where does the tension in the
rope achieve its maximum value? Hint: no messy calculations
required.

5.66. Force from a straight wire ***

A particle of mass m is placed a distance (cid:2) away from an infinitely long
straight wire with mass density σ kg/m. Show that the force on the
particle is F = 2Gσ m/(cid:2). Do this in two ways:

(a) Integrate along the wire the contributions to the force.
(b) Integrate along the wire the contributions to the potential, and then
differentiate to obtain the force. You will find that the potential due
to the infinite wire is infinite,31 but you can escape this difficulty
by letting the wire have a large but finite length, then finding the
potential and force, and then letting the length go to infinity.

5.67. Maximal gravity ***

Given a point P in space, and given a piece of malleable material of
constant density, how should you shape and place the material in order
to create the largest possible gravitational field at P?

Section 5.5: Momentum

5.68. Maximum P and E of a rocket *

A rocket that starts at rest with mass M ejects exhaust at a given speed
u. What is the mass of the rocket (including unused fuel) when its
momentum is maximum? What is the mass when its energy is maximum?

5.69. Speedy rockets *

Assume that it is impossible to build a structurally sound container that
can hold fuel of more than, say, nine times its mass (the actual limit
is higher than this, but let’s use this number just to be concrete). It
would then seem like the limit for the speed of a rocket is u ln 10, from
Eq. (5.54). How can you build a rocket that goes faster than this?

30 Any proposed space elevator wouldn’t have uniform mass density. But this simplified problem
still gives a good idea of the general features. For more on the space elevator, see Aravind (2007).
31 There’s nothing bad about this. All that matters as far as the force is concerned is differences in

the potential, and these differences are finite.

5.70. Snow on a sled, quantitative **

Consider the setup in the example in Section 5.5.1. At t = 0, let the mass
of the sled (including you) be M , and let its speed be V0. If the snow
hits the sled at a rate of σ kg/s, find the speed as a function of time for
the three cases.

5.71. Leaky bucket ***

Consider the setup in Problem 5.17, but now let the sand leak at a rate
dm/dt = −bM . In other words, the rate is constant with respect to time,
not distance. We’ve factored out an M here, just to make the calculations
a little nicer.

(a) Find v(t) and x(t) during the time when the bucket contains a

nonzero amount of sand.

(b) What is the maximum value of the bucket’s kinetic energy,

assuming it is achieved before it hits the wall?

A brick is thrown from ground level, at an angle θ with respect to the
(horizontal) ground. Assume that the long face of the brick remains
parallel to the ground at all times, and that there is no deformation in the
ground or the brick when the brick hits the ground. If the coefficient of
friction between the brick and the ground is µ, what should θ be so that
the brick travels the maximum total horizontal distance before finally
coming to rest? Assume that the brick doesn’t bounce. Hint: The brick
slows down when it hits the ground. Think in terms of impulse.

Seven pool balls are situated at rest as shown in Fig. 5.45. The middle ball
suddenly somehow acquires a speed v to the right. Assume that starting
with ball A, the balls spiral out an infinitesimal amount. So A is closer to
the center ball than B is, and B is closer than C is, etc. This means that the
center ball collides with A first, then it gets deflected into B, and then it
gets deflected into C, and so on. But all the collisions happen in the blink
of an eye. What will the center ball’s velocity be after it collides (elas-
tically) with all six balls? (You can use the results from the example in
Section 5.7.2.)

5.77. Midair collision **

A ball is held and then released. At the instant it is released, an identical
ball, moving horizontally with speed v, collides elastically with it and is
deflected at an upward angle. What is the maximum horizontal distance
the latter ball can travel by the time it returns to the height of the collision?
(You can use the results from the example in Section 5.7.2.)

5.78. Maximum number of collisions **

by working in the lab frame in the example in Section 5.7.2.)

5.82. Equal vx’s **

A mass m moving with speed v in the x direction collides elastically with
a stationary mass nm, where n is some number. After the collision, it is

5.84. Bouncing between rings **

Two fixed circular rings, in contact with each other, stand in a vertical
plane. A ball bounces elastically back and forth between the rings (see
Fig. 5.48). Assume that initial conditions have been set up so that the
ball’s motion forever lies in one parabola. Let this parabola hit the rings
at an angle θ from the horizontal. Show that if you want the magnitude
of the change in the horizontal component of the ball’s momentum at
each bounce to be maximum, then you should pick cos θ = (

been set up so that the ball’s motion forever lies in one parabola, with the
contact points located at ±x0. For what function f (x) is the magnitude
of the change in the horizontal component of the ball’s momentum at

5.87. Balls in a semicircle ***

N identical balls lie equally spaced in a semicircle on a frictionless
horizontal table, as shown. The total mass of these balls is M . Another
ball of mass m approaches the semicircle from the left, with the proper
initial conditions so that it bounces (elastically) off all N balls and finally
leaves the semicircle, heading directly to the left (see Fig. 5.50).

(a) In the limit N → ∞ (so the mass of each ball in the semicircle,
M /N , goes to zero), find the minimum value of M /m that allows
the incoming ball to come out heading directly to the left. Hint:
You’ll need to do Problem 5.24 first.

(b) In the minimum M /m case found in part (a), show that the ratio

of m’s final speed to initial speed equals e−π .

5.88. Block and bouncing ball ****

A block with large mass M slides with speed V0 on a frictionless table
toward a wall. It collides elastically with a ball with small mass m, which
is initially at rest at a distance L from the wall. The ball slides toward the
wall, bounces elastically, and then proceeds to bounce back and forth
between the block and the wall.

(a) How close does the block come to the wall?
(b) How many times does the ball bounce off the block, by the time

the block makes its closest approach to the wall?

chain is raised by a very small distance, b, and then released. What is
the amplitude of the oscillations, as a function of time?

Assume that (1) L (cid:6) b, (2) the chain is very thin, so that the size of
the heap on the floor is very small compared with b, (3) the length of
the chain in the initial heap is larger than b, so that some of the chain
always remains in contact with the floor, and (4) there is no friction of
the chain with itself inside the heap.

5.11 Solutions

5.1. Minimum length

Drop the masses through the three holes, and let the system reach its equilibrium
position. The equilibrium position is the one with the lowest potential energy of the
masses, that is, the one with the most string hanging below the table. In other words, it
is the one with the least string lying on the table. This is the desired minimum-length
configuration.

What are the angles at the vertex of the string? The tensions in all three strings are
equal to mg, because they are holding up the masses. The vertex of the string is in
equilibrium, so the net force on it must be zero. This implies that each string must
bisect the angle formed by the other two. Therefore, the angles between the strings
must all be 120◦.

5.2. Heading to zero

The energy of the particle is E = mv2/2 − A|x|n. The given information tells us that
v = 0 when x = 0. Therefore, E = 0, which then implies that v = −
2Axn/m (we’ll
assume x > 0; the x < 0 case works the same). We have chosen the minus sign because
the particle is heading toward the origin. Writing v as dx/dt and separating variables
gives

where x0 is the initial position and T is the time to reach the origin. The integral on the
left is finite if and only if n/2 < 1. Therefore, the condition that T is finite is n < 2.

If 0 < n < 1, then V (x) has a cusp at x = 0 (infinite slope on either side),
Remark:
so it’s clear that T is finite. If n = 1, then the slope is a finite constant, so it’s also clear
than T is finite. If n > 1, then the slope of V (x) is zero at x = 0, so it’s not obvious
what happens with T . But the above calculation shows that n = 2 is the value where
T becomes infinite.

The particle therefore takes a finite time to reach the top of a triangle or the curve
−Ax3/2. But it takes an infinite time to reach the top of a parabola, cubic, etc. A circle
looks like a parabola at the top, so T is infinite in that case also. In fact, any nice
polynomial function V (x) requires an infinite T to reach a local maximum, because
the Taylor series starts at order two (at least) around an extremum. ♣

5.3. Leaving the sphere

First solution: Let R be the radius of the sphere, and let θ be the angle of the mass,
measured from the top of the sphere. The radial F = ma equation is

mg cos θ − N = mv2
R

,

(5.85)

where N is the normal force. The mass loses contact with the sphere when the normal
force becomes zero (that is, when the normal component of gravity is barely large
enough to account for the centripetal acceleration of the mass). Therefore, the mass
loses contact when

mv2
R

= mg cos θ .

(5.86)

But conservation of energy gives mv2/2 = mgR(1 − cos θ ). Hence, v =
(cid:4)

2gR(1 − cos θ). Plugging this into Eq. (5.86) gives

cos θ = 2
3

=⇒ θ ≈ 48.2

◦

.

(5.87)

Second solution: Let’s assume (incorrectly) that the mass always stays in contact
with the sphere, and then find the point where the horizontal component of v starts
to decrease, which it of course can’t do, because the normal force doesn’t have a
“backward” component. From above, the horizontal component of v is

vx = v cos θ =

2gR(1 − cos θ ) cos θ .

(5.88)

(cid:4)

Taking the derivative of this, we find that the maximum occurs when cos θ = 2/3.
So this is where vx would start to decrease if the mass were constrained to remain on
the sphere. But there is no such constraining force available, so the mass loses contact
when cos θ = 2/3.

5.4. Pulling the pucks

(a) Let θ be defined as in Fig. 5.55. Then the tension in the string is T = F/(2 cos θ ),
because the force on the massless kink in the string must be zero. Consider the
“top” puck. The component of the tension in the y direction is −T sin θ =
−(F/2) tan θ. The work done on the puck by this component is therefore

system A

By the work–energy theorem (or equivalently, by separating variables and inte-
grating Fy = mvy dvy/dy), this work equals the value of mv2
/2 right before the
y
collision. There are two pucks, so the total kinetic energy lost when they stick
together is twice this quantity (vx doesn’t change during the collision), which
is F(cid:2).

(b) Consider two systems, A and B (see Fig. 5.56). A is the original setup, while B
starts with θ already at zero. Let the pucks in both systems start simultaneously at
x = 0. As the force F is applied, all four pucks will have the same x(t), because
the same force in the x direction, namely F/2, is applied to every puck at all
times. After the collision, both systems will therefore look exactly the same.

Let the collision of the pucks occur at x = d. At this point, F(d + (cid:2)) work
has been done on system A, because the center of the string (where the force

F

is applied) ends up moving a distance (cid:2) more than the masses. However, only
Fd work has been done on system B. Since both systems have the same kinetic
energy after the collision, the extra F(cid:2) work done on system A must be what is
lost in the collision.

Remark: The reasoning in this second solution can be used to solve the problem
in the case where we have a uniform massive rope (so the rope flops down, as in
Fig. 5.57). The center of mass of the rope moves in exactly the same manner as
the position of the two pucks in system B (assuming that the mass of each puck
is chosen to be half the mass of the rope), because the same force F acts on both
systems. You can show that this implies that the force acts over an extra distance
of (cid:2)/2 on the rope, compared with system B, by the time the rope has flopped
into a straight line. From the reasoning above, F(cid:2)/2 of work must therefore be
lost to heat in the rope. ♣

The vertical component of the velocity is ˙y = v sin θ , where θ is the (negative) angle

which yields sin θ = y(cid:16)/
1 + y(cid:16)2. The requirement ˙y = −v0, which is equivalent to
v sin θ = −v0, may therefore be written as

5.6. Dividing the heat

It turns out that it isn’t possible to answer these questions without being given more
information. The way that the work is divided up between the objects depends on what
their surfaces look like. It’s theoretically possible for one of the objects to gain all the
heat, while the other doesn’t heat up at all.

To understand this, we’ll need to make a model of how friction works. The general
way that friction works is that molecules from one surface rub against molecules from
the other surface. The molecules stretch to the side and then bounce back and vibrate.
This vibrational motion is the kinetic energy associated with heat. The model we’ll
use here will have a bunch of springs with masses on the ends, on both surfaces at the
interface. When the surfaces rub against each other, the masses catch on each other
for a short time (as shown in Fig. 5.58), and then they release, whereupon they vibrate
back and forth on the springs. This is the kinetic energy of the heat we see. Though an
oversimplification, this is basically the way friction works.

Now, if everything is symmetrical between the two objects (that is, if the springs and
masses on one object look like those on the other), then both objects will heat up by

F

Fig. 5.57

block

F

table

Fig. 5.58

5.11 Solutions

197

the same amount. But things need not be symmetrical. You can imagine the springs on
one surface being much stiffer (that is, having a much larger k value) than the springs
on the other surface. Or, you can even take the limit where one surface (say, the block)
is made of completely rigid teeth, as shown (for one tooth) in Fig. 5.59. In this case,
only the bottom surface (the table) will end up with heat from vibrational motion.

Is this asymmetrical result consistent with what we obtain from the work–energy
theorem? Well, the net work done on the block is zero, because your pulling force does
Fd positive work (where F = µk N ), while the friction force (the sum of all the forces
from the masses on the little teeth) does Fd negative work. Therefore, since zero net
work is done on the block, its total energy is constant. And since the kinetic energy due
to its motion as a whole is constant, its internal thermal energy must also be constant.
In other words, it doesn’t heat up.

The net work done on the table in this scenario comes from the force from the teeth
on the little masses on the springs. These teeth do Fd positive work on all the little
spring–mass systems, so Fd is the work done on the table. Therefore, its total energy
increases by Fd. And since the kinetic energy due to its motion as a whole is constant
(and zero, since the table is just sitting there), its internal thermal energy must increase
by Fd. In other words, it heats up.

Now consider the reverse situation, where the table has the rigid teeth and the block
has the springs and masses, as shown in Fig. 5.60. The block is now the object that
heats up, because it has the vibrational motion of the masses. And as above, we can
show that this is consistent with the work–energy theorem, as follows. In the present
case, the force from the table’s teeth does no work on the block (because the teeth
aren’t moving), so the net work done on the block is simply the Fd from your pulling,
so it heats up. Likewise, the little masses do no work on the teeth (because the teeth
aren’t moving), so the work done on the table is zero, so it doesn’t heat up.

For the in between case where the spring constants on the two objects are equal, the
net work done on each object is Fd/2, where d is the distance the block moves. This
is true because the two masses in Fig. 5.58 each move half as far as the block moves.
So the work done on the block is Fd − Fd/2 = Fd/2 (this is the positive work done
by you, plus the negative work done by the table’s little masses). And the work done
on the table is Fd/2 (this is the positive work done by the block’s little masses). So the
objects heat up the same amount. For more discussion of the issues in this problem,
see Sherwood (1984).

5.7. V (x) vs. a hill

First solution: Consider the normal force N acting on the bead at a given point. Let
θ be the angle that the tangent to V (x) makes with the horizontal, as shown in Fig. 5.61.
The horizontal F = ma equation is

−N sin θ = m¨x.

(5.94)

The vertical F = ma equation is

N cos θ − mg = m¨y =⇒ N cos θ = mg + m¨y.

(5.95)

Dividing Eq. (5.94) by Eq. (5.95) gives

− tan θ =

¨x
g + ¨y

.

(5.96)

But tan θ = V (cid:16)(x). Therefore,

We see that this is not equal to −gV (cid:16). In fact, there is in general no way to construct
a curve with height z(x) that gives the same horizontal motion that a 1-D potential
mgV (x) gives, for all initial conditions. We would need −(g + ¨z)z(cid:16) = −gV (cid:16), for all
x. But at a given x, the quantities V (cid:16) and z(cid:16) are fixed, whereas ¨z depends on the initial

conditions. For example, if there is a bend in the wire, then ¨z will be large if ˙z is large.
And ˙z depends (in general) on how far the bead has fallen.

Equation (5.97) holds the key to constructing a situation that does give the ¨x = −gV (cid:16)
result. All we have to do is get rid of the ¨y term. So here’s what we do. We grab our
y = V (x) wire and move it up and/or down in precisely the manner that makes the bead
stay at the same height with respect to the ground. (Actually, constant vertical speed
would be good enough.) This will make the ¨y term vanish, as desired. The vertical
movement of the curve doesn’t change the slope V (cid:16) at a given value of x, so the θ in
the above derivation is still the same θ .

Note that the quantity y here is the vertical position of the bead. It equals V (x) if the

curve is stationary, but not if the curve is being moved up and down.

Remark: There is one case where ¨x is (approximately) equal to −gV (cid:16), even when the
wire remains stationary. In the case of small oscillations of the bead near a minimum
of V (x), ¨y is small compared with g. Hence, Eq. (5.97) shows that ¨x is approximately
equal to −gV (cid:16). Therefore, for small oscillations, it is reasonable to model a particle
in a 1-D potential mgV (x) as a particle sliding in a valley whose height is given
by y = V (x). ♣

Second solution: The component of gravity along the wire is what causes the change
in velocity of the bead. That is,

−g sin θ = dv
dt

(5.98)

where θ is given by

(cid:16)(x) =⇒ sin θ =

We are, however, not concerned with the rate of change of v, but rather with the rate
of change of ˙x. In view of this, let us write v in terms of ˙x. Since ˙x = v cos θ , we
1 + V (cid:16)2 (dots denote d/dt, primes denote d/dx). Therefore,
have v = ˙x/ cos θ = ˙x

We’ll simplify this in a moment, but first a remark.

(5.101)

we might think that

¨x =

(incorrect).

(5.102)

We have missed the second term in Eq. (5.101). Where is the mistake? The error is that
we forgot to take into account the possible change in the curve’s slope (Eq. (5.102) is
true for straight lines). We addressed only the acceleration due to a change in speed.
We forgot to consider the acceleration due to a change in the direction of motion (the
term we missed is the one with dV (cid:16)/dt). Intuitively, if we have a sharp enough bend in

5.11 Solutions

199

the wire, then ˙x can change at an arbitrarily large rate, even if v is roughly constant.
In view of this fact, Eq. (5.102) is definitely incorrect, because it is bounded (by g/2,
in fact). ♣

To simplify Eq. (5.101), note that V (cid:16) ≡ dV/dx = (dV/dt)/(dx/dt) ≡ ˙V /˙x ( ˙V is just
the rate of change in the bead’s height). Therefore, the numerator in the second term

¨x = −(g + ¨V )V
(5.104)
in agreement with Eq. (5.97), because y = V (x) if the wire is stationary.
Equation (5.104) is valid only for a curve V (x) that remains fixed. If we grab the
wire and start moving it up and down, then the above solution is invalid, because the
starting point, Eq. (5.98), rests on the assumption that gravity is the only force that
does work on the bead. But if we move the wire, then the normal force also does work.
It turns out that for a moving wire, we simply need to replace the ¨V in Eq. (5.104)
by ¨y, which then gives Eq. (5.97). This can be seen by looking at things in the vertically
accelerating frame in which the wire is at rest. We won’t cover accelerating frames
until Chapter 10, so we’ll just invoke here the result that there is an extra fictitious
“translational” force in this accelerating frame, and the consequence of this is that the
bead thinks that it lives in a world where the acceleration from gravity is g + ¨h (if ¨h is
positive, then the bead thinks gravity is larger), where h is the position of your hand
that is accelerating the wire. In this new frame, the wire is at rest, so the above solution
is valid. So with the g in Eq. (5.104) replaced by g + ¨h, we have ¨x = −(g + ¨h + ¨V )V (cid:16).
But ¨V (which is the vertical acceleration of the bead with respect to the new frame)
plus ¨h (which is the vertical acceleration of the new frame with respect to the ground)
equals ¨y (which, by our definition in the first solution, is the vertical acceleration of
the bead with respect to the ground). We have therefore reproduced Eq. (5.97).

Remark: This is independent of y0, which makes sense because the only effect of
gravity is to change the equilibrium position. More precisely, if yr is the position
relative to y0 (so that y ≡ y0 + yr), then the total force as a function of yr is

F(yr) = −k(y0 + yr) − mg = −k

Let a be the distance from P to piece A, and let b be the distance from P to piece B
(see Fig. 5.62). Draw the “perpendicular” bases of the cones, and call them A(cid:16) and
B(cid:16). The ratio of the areas of A(cid:16) and B(cid:16) is a2/b2. The key point here is that the angle
between the planes of A and A(cid:16) is the same as the angle between B and B(cid:16). This is true
because the chord between A and B meets the circle at equal angles at its ends. So the
ratio of the areas of A and B is also a2/b2. But the gravitational force decreases like
1/r2, and this effect exactly cancels the a2/b2 ratio of the areas. Therefore, the forces
at P due to A and B (which can be treated like point masses, because the cones are
assumed to be thin) are equal in magnitude; and opposite in direction, of course. If we
draw enough cones to cover the whole shell, then the contributions to the force from
little pieces over the whole shell cancel in pairs, so we are left with zero force at P.
This holds for any point P inside the shell.

Remark:
Interestingly, the force inside an ellipsoidal shell of constant density (per
volume) is also zero, assuming that the shell is defined to be the region between the
surfaces described by ax2 + by2 + cz2 = k, for two different values of k. In short,
this is true because an ellipsoid is simply a stretched sphere. In detail: Let the above
spherical shell have some thickness dr (which was irrelevant for the sphere, but it will
be important in the ellipsoid case). From above, we know that the masses at the ends
of the thin cones in the sphere have canceling forces. If we now stretch the sphere into
an ellipsoid (uniformly in each direction, but the factors in the three directions can be
different), then the distances from the end masses to P will still be in the ratio of a to b
(as you can verify). And the end masses will still be in the ratio of a2 to b2, because both
masses change by the same factor. This is true because every infinitesimal cube in the
end masses has its volume changed by the same factor (namely fx fy fz, where these f ’s
are the stretching factors in each direction). So the masses are still in the ratio of a2 to
b2, and the same argument about canceling forces holds as in the spherical case. Note
that this zero-force result is not true for an ellipsoid with constant thickness, because
such an object isn’t the result of stretching a spherical shell (because a stretching results
in the ellipsoidal shell being thicker near the ends where it is more “pointy”). ♣

Numerically, this is

2(6.67 · 10−11 m3/kg s2)(2 · 1030 kg)/(1.5 · 1011 m) ≈ 42 km/s.

If you want to bring the earth back in (but let’s assume it’s at rest and not orbiting)
and find the escape velocity (from both the sun and the earth) from a point on the
earth’s surface, you can’t just add the 42 km/s and 11.2 km/s results. Instead,
you have to take the square root of the sum of the squares. This follows from
Eq. (5.112) and from the fact that potentials simply add. The result is about
43.5 km/s. The task of Exercise 5.60 is to find the escape velocity if the orbital
motion of the earth is included. ♣

(b) To get a rough answer, we’ll assume that the initial speed of a person’s jump
on the small planet is the same as it is on the earth. This probably isn’t quite
true, but it’s close enough for the purposes here. A good jump on the earth is
about a meter. For this jump, conservation of energy gives mv2/2 = mg(1 m).
Therefore, v =

Remark: For everyday values of R, this is a very small number because G

if it is made of a material with density ρ (per unit volume), then σ = ρd.
So ω =
2πρdG/R. In the above analysis, we assumed that the sheet was
infinitely thin. In practice, we need d to be much smaller than the amplitude
of the motion. But this amplitude must be much smaller than R in order for
our approximation to hold. So we conclude that d (cid:4) R. To get a rough upper
bound on ω, let’s pick d/R = 1/10. And let’s make our sheet out of gold (with
ρ ≈ 2 · 104 kg/m3). We then find ω ≈ 1 · 10−3 s−1, which corresponds to
an oscillation about every 100 minutes. For the analogous system consisting of

All of the snowball’s momentum goes into the earth, which then translates (and rotates)
a tiny bit faster (or slower, depending on which way the snowball was thrown).

What about the energy? Let m and v be the mass and initial speed of the snowball.
Let M and V be the mass and final speed of the earth (with respect to the original rest

There is also a rotational kinetic-energy term of the same order of magnitude, but that
doesn’t matter. We see that essentially none of the snowball’s energy goes into the
earth. It therefore must all go into the form of heat, which melts some of the snow
(and/or heats up the wall). This is a general result for a small object hitting a large
object: The large object picks up essentially all of the momentum but essentially none
of the energy (except possibly in the form of heat).

5.15. Propelling a car

Let the speed of the car be v(t). Consider the collision of a ball of mass dm with the car.
In the instantaneous rest frame of the car, the speed of the ball is u − v. In this frame,
the ball reverses velocity when it bounces (because the car is so much more massive),
so its change in momentum is −2(u − v) dm. This is also the change in momentum
in the lab frame, because the two frames are related by a given speed at any instant.
Therefore, in the lab frame the car gains a momentum of 2(u − v) dm from each ball
that hits it. The rate of change in momentum of the car (that is, the force) is thus

dp
dt

= 2σ (cid:16)(u − v),

(5.125)

where σ (cid:16) ≡ dm/dt is the rate at which mass hits the car. σ (cid:16) is related to the given σ by
σ (cid:16) = σ (u − v)/u, because although you throw the balls at speed u, the relative speed
of the balls and the car is only (u − v). We therefore have

We can carry over some of the results from the previous problem. The only change in

where m(t) is the mass of the car-plus-contents, as a function of time. The main
difference between this problem and the previous one is that this mass m changes
because the balls are collecting inside the car. From the previous problem, the rate at
which mass enters the car is σ (cid:16) = σ (u − v)/u. Therefore,

makes sense, because in the present problem the balls have less of an effect on v(t),
because (1) they don’t bounce back, and (2) the mass of the car-plus-contents is larger.

5.17. Leaky bucket

(a) First solution: The initial position is x = L. The given rate of leaking implies
that the mass of the bucket at position x is m = M (x/L). Therefore, F = ma

(5.135)

33 We can also quickly derive this equation by writing down conservation of momentum for the
time interval when a mass dm enters the car: dm u + mv = (m + dm)(v + dv). This yields the
first equality in Eq. (5.130). But we will still need to use one of Eqs. (5.128) and (5.129) in what
follows.

5.11 Solutions

205

Note that the (fractional) location of Emax is independent of M , T , and L, but its
value depends on T and L. These facts follow from dimensional analysis.

Remark: We began this solution by writing down F = ma, where m is the
mass of the bucket. You may be wondering why we didn’t use F = dp/dt,
where p is the momentum of the bucket. This would certainly give a different
result, because dp/dt = d(mv)/dt = ma + (dm/dt)v. We used F = ma because
at any instant the mass m is what is being accelerated by the force F.

If you want, you can imagine the process occurring in discrete steps: The
force pulls on the mass for a short period of time, then a little piece falls off.
Then the force pulls again on the new mass, then another little piece falls off.
And so on. In this scenario, it is clear that F = ma is the appropriate formula,
because it holds for each step in the process.

It is indeed true that F = dp/dt, if you let F be total force in the problem,
and let p be the total momentum. The tension T is the only horizontal force in
the problem, because we’ve assumed the ground to be frictionless. However,
the total momentum consists of both the sand in the bucket and the sand that has
leaked out and is sliding along on the ground. If we use F = dp/dt, where p is
the total momentum, we obtain (remember that dm/dt is a negative quantity)

F = dp/dt. ♣

Second solution: Consider a small time interval during which the bucket
moves from x to x + dx (where dx is negative). The bucket’s kinetic energy
changes by (−T ) dx (this is positive) due to the work done by the spring, and
also changes by a fraction dx/x (this is negative) due to the leaking. Therefore,
dE = −T dx + E dx/x, or

dE

= −T + E

(5.137)

In solving this differential equation, it is convenient to introduce the variable
y ≡ E/x. Then E(cid:16) = xy(cid:16) + y, where a prime denotes differentiation with respect
to x. Equation (5.137) then becomes xy(cid:16) = −T , which gives

Note that the (fractional) location of pmax is independent of M, T, and L, but its
value depends on all three. These facts follow from dimensional analysis.

Remark: Emax occurs closer to the wall (that is, at a later time) than pmax. The
reason for this is that v matters more in E = mv2/2 than it does in p = mv. As
far as E is concerned, it is beneficial for the bucket to lose a little more mass if
it means being able to pick up a little more speed (up to a certain point). ♣

Conservation of energy and momentum

5.18. Another leaky bucket

(a) F = ma gives −T = m¨x. Combining this with the given dm/dt = b¨x equation
yields m dm = −bT dt. Integration then gives m2/2 = C − bTt. But m = M
when t = 0, so we have C = M 2/2. Therefore,

(cid:4)

m(t) =

M 2 − 2bTt .

(5.141)

This holds for t < M 2/2bT , provided that the bucket hasn’t hit the wall yet.
(b) The given equation dm/dt = b¨x = b dv/dt integrates to v = m/b + D. But

v = 0 when m = M , so we have D = −M /b. Therefore,

v(m) = m − M

At the instant right before all the sand leaves the bucket, we have m = 0.

x(m) = L −

5.19. Right angle in billiards

Let v be the initial velocity, and let v1 and v2 be the final velocities. Since the masses
are equal, conservation of momentum gives v = v1 + v2. Taking the dot product of
this equation with itself gives

v · v = v1 · v1 + 2v1 · v2 + v2 · v2.

(5.150)

5.11 Solutions

207

And conservation of energy gives (dropping the factors of m/2)

v · v = v1 · v1 + v2 · v2.

(5.151)

Taking the difference of these two equations yields

v1 · v2 = 0.
(5.152)
So v1v2 cos θ = 0, which means that θ = 90◦. (Or v1 = 0, which means the incoming
mass stops because the collision is head-on. Or v2 = 0, which means the masses miss
each other.)

5.20. Bouncing and recoiling

Let vi be the speed of the ball after the ith bounce, and let Vi be the speed of the block
right after the ith bounce. Then conservation of momentum gives

mvi = MVi+1 − mvi+1.
But Theorem 5.3 says that vi = Vi+1+vi+1. Solving this system of two linear equations
gives

(5.153)

vi+1 =

(M − m)vi
M + m

≡

(1 − (cid:9))vi
1 + (cid:9)

≈ (1 − 2(cid:9))vi,

and Vi+1 ≈ 2(cid:9)vi,

(5.154)

where (cid:9) ≡ m/M (cid:4) 1. This expression for vi+1 implies that the speed of the ball after
the nth bounce is

vn = (1 − 2(cid:9))nv0, where (cid:9) ≡ m/M .

(5.155)

The total distance traveled by the block can be obtained by looking at the work done
by friction. Eventually, the ball has negligible energy, so all of its initial kinetic energy
goes into heat from friction. Therefore, mv2
0

/2 = Ff d = (µMg)d, which gives

d =

mv2
0
2µMg

.

(5.156)

To find the total time, we can add up the times, tn, the block moves after each bounce.
Since the product of force and time equals the change in momentum, we have Ff tn =
MVn, and so (µMg)tn = M (2(cid:9)vn−1) = 2M (cid:9)(1 − 2(cid:9))n−1v0. Therefore,

t =

∞(cid:19)

(5.157)

We’ve let the sum go to n = ∞ even though our vn = (1 − 2(cid:9))nv0 approximation
eventually breaks down for very large n (because we dropped terms of order (cid:9)2 in
deriving it). But by the time it breaks down, the terms are negligibly small anyway.
The calculation of d above can also be done by adding up the geometric series of the
distances moved after each bounce.

Remarks: This t = v0/µg result is much larger than the result obtained in the case
where the ball sticks to the block on the first hit, in which case the answer is t =
mv0/(µMg). The total time is proportional to the total momentum that the block picks
up, and the t = v0/µg answer is larger because the wall keeps transferring positive
momentum to the ball, which then gets transferred to the block.

In contrast, d is the same as it would be in the case where the ball sticks to the block
on the first hit. The total distance is proportional to the total energy that the block picks
/2. The wall (which is
up, and in both cases the total energy given to the block is mv2
0
attached to the very massive earth) transfers essentially no energy to the ball.

The t = v0/µg result is independent of the masses (as long as M (cid:6) m), although
it’s not at all intuitively obvious that if we keep the same v0, but decrease m by a factor

208

Conservation of energy and momentum

of 100, that we’ll end up with the same t. The distance d, on the other hand, would
decrease by 100. ♣

5.21. Drag force on a sheet

(a) We will set v = 0 here. When the sheet hits a particle, the particle acquires
a speed of essentially 2V . This follows from Theorem 5.3, or by working in
the frame of the heavy sheet. The momentum of the particle is then 2mV . In
time t, the sheet sweeps through a volume AVt, where A is the area of the
sheet. Therefore, in time t, the sheet hits AVtn particles. The sheet therefore
loses momentum at a rate of dP/dt = −(AVn)(2mV ). But F = dP/dt, so the
magnitude of the drag force per unit area is

F
A

= 2nmV 2 ≡ 2ρV 2,

(5.158)

where ρ is the mass density of the particles. We see that the force depends
quadratically on V .

(b) If v (cid:6) V , the particles now hit the sheet from various directions on both sides,
but we need only consider the particles’ motions along the line of the sheet’s
motion. As stated in the problem, we will assume that all velocities in this
direction are equal to ±v/2. Note that we won’t be able to set V exactly equal
to zero here, because we would obtain a force of zero and miss the lowest-order
effect.

Consider a particle in front of the sheet, moving backward toward the sheet.
The relative speed between the particle and the sheet is v/2 + V . This relative
speed reverses direction during the collision, so the change in momentum of the
particle is 2m(v/2 + V ). We have used the fact that the speed of the heavy sheet
is essentially unaffected by the collision. The rate at which particles collide with
the sheet is A(v/2 + V )(n/2), from the reasoning in part (a). The n/2 factor
comes from the fact that half of the particles move toward the sheet, and half
move away from it.

Now consider a particle behind the sheet, moving forward toward the sheet.
The relative speed between the particle and the sheet is v/2 − V . This relative
speed reverses direction during the collision, so the change in momentum of this
particle is −2m(v/2 − V ). And the rate at which particles collide with the sheet
is A(v/2 − V )(n/2). Therefore, the magnitude of the drag force per unit area is

v = V is coincidence. Neither result is valid when v = V .

5.22. Drag force on a cylinder

Consider a particle that makes contact with the cylinder at an angle θ with respect
to the line of motion. In the frame of the heavy cylinder (see Fig. 5.63), the particle
comes in with velocity −V and then bounces off with a horizontal velocity component
of V cos 2θ. So in this frame (and hence also in the lab frame), the particle increases
its horizontal momentum by mV (1 + cos 2θ ). The cylinder must therefore lose this
momentum.

The area on the cylinder that lies between θ and θ + dθ sweeps out volume at a
rate (R dθ cos θ)V (cid:2), where (cid:2) is the length of the cylinder. The cos θ factor here gives

in the previous problem, as it should be, because the particles bounce off somewhat
sideways in the cylinder case.

5.23. Basketball and tennis ball

(a) Right before the basketball hits the ground, both balls move downward with

speed (using mv2/2 = mgh)

(cid:4)

2gh.

v =

(5.161)

Right after the basketball bounces off the ground, it moves upward with speed
v, while the tennis ball still moves downward with speed v. The relative speed
is therefore 2v. After the balls bounce off each other, the relative speed is still
2v (this follows from Theorem 5.3, or by working in the frame of the heavy
basketball). Since the upward speed of the basketball essentially stays equal to
v, the upward speed of the tennis ball is 2v + v = 3v. By conservation of energy,
it therefore rises to a height of H = d + (3v)2/(2g). But v2 = 2gh, so we have

H = d + 9h.

(5.162)

(cid:4)

(b) Right before B1 hits the ground, all of the balls move downward with speed
v =
2gh. We will inductively determine the speed of each ball after it bounces
off the one below it. If Bi achieves a speed of vi after bouncing off Bi−1, then
what is the speed of Bi+1 after it bounces off Bi? The relative speed of Bi+1 and
Bi (right before they bounce) is v + vi. This is also the relative speed after they
bounce. Therefore, since Bi is still moving upward at essentially speed vi, we
see that the final upward speed of Bi+1 equals (v + vi) + vi. Thus,

vi+1 = 2vi + v.

(5.163)

Since v1 = v, we obtain v2 = 3v (in agreement with part (a)), and then v3 = 7v,
and then v4 = 15v, etc. In general,

vn = (2n − 1)v,

(5.164)

which is easily seen to satisfy Eq. (5.163), with the initial value v1 = v. From
conservation of energy, Bn therefore rises to a height of

H = (cid:2) +

((2n − 1)v)2
2g

= (cid:2) + (2n − 1)2h.

(5.165)

If h is 1 meter, and if we want this height to be 1000 meters, then (assuming (cid:2)
is not very large) we need 2n − 1 >
1000. Five balls won’t quite do the trick,

(5.166)

5.24. Maximal deflection

First solution: Let’s figure out what the collision looks like in the CM frame. If M has
initial speed V in the lab frame, then the CM moves with speed VCM = MV /(M + m).
The speeds of M and m in the CM frame therefore equal, respectively,

U = V − VCM = mV
M + m

,

and

u = | − VCM| = MV
M + m

.

(5.167)

In the CM frame, the collision is simple. The particles keep the same speeds, but
simply change their directions (while still moving in opposite directions), as shown
in Fig. 5.64. The angle θ is free to have any value. This scenario clearly satisfies
conservation of energy and momentum, so it must be what happens.

The important point to note is that since θ can have any value, the tip of the U
velocity vector can be located anywhere on a circle of radius U . If we then shift back
to the lab frame, we see that the final velocity of M with respect to the lab frame,
Vlab, is obtained by adding VCM to the vector U, which can point anywhere on the
dotted circle in Fig. 5.65. A few possibilities for Vlab are shown. The largest angle of
deflection is obtained when Vlab is tangent to the dotted circle, in which case we have
the situation shown in Fig. 5.66. The maximum angle of deflection, φmax, is therefore
given by

sin φmax = U
VCM

= mV /(M + m)
MV /(M + m)

.

(5.168)

If M < m, then the dotted circle passes to the left of the left vertex of the triangle.
This means that φ can take on any value. In particular, it is possible for M to bounce
directly backward.
Second solution: We’ll work in the lab frame in this solution. Let V (cid:16) and v(cid:16) be the
final speeds, and let φ and γ be the scattering angles of M and m, respectively, in the
lab frame. Then conservation of px, py, and E give

(b) In this frame, mass m has initial speed V , so its initial energy is Ei = mV 2/2. By

This negligible final energy of zero is mV 2/2 less than Ei. Therefore, mV 2/2 is
lost to heat, in agreement with part (a).

5.26. Pulling a chain

Let x be the distance your hand has moved. Then x/2 is the length of the moving part
of the chain, because the chain gets “doubled up.” The momentum of this moving part
is therefore p = (σ x/2)˙x. The force that your hand applies is found from F = dp/dt,
which gives F = (σ/2)(˙x2 + x¨x). But since v is constant, the ¨x term vanishes. The
change in momentum here is due simply to additional mass acquiring speed v, and not
due to any increase in speed of the part already moving. Hence,

F =

σ v2

2

,

(5.177)

which is constant. Your hand applies this force over a total distance 2L, so the total
work you do is

F(2L) = σ Lv2.

(5.178)

The mass of the chain is σ L, so its final kinetic energy is (σ L)v2/2. This is only half
of the work you do. Therefore, an energy of σ Lv2/2 is lost to heat. Each atom in the
chain goes abruptly from rest to speed v, and there is no way to avoid heat loss in such
a process. This is clear when viewed in the reference frame of your hand. In this frame,
the chain initially moves at speed v and then eventually comes to rest, piece by piece.
So all of its initial kinetic energy, (σ L)v2/2, goes into heat.

212

Conservation of energy and momentum

5.27. Pulling a chain again

Let x be the position of the end of the chain. The momentum of the chain is then
p = (σ x)˙x. F = dp/dt gives (using the fact that F is constant) Ft = p, so we have
Ft = (σ x)˙x. Separating variables and integrating yields

The position therefore grows linearly with time. In other words, the speed is constant,
and it equals

Remark: Realistically, when you grab the chain, there is some small initial value of
x (call it (cid:9)). The dx integral above now starts at (cid:9) instead of 0, so x takes the form,
F/σ . Even
x =
F/σ as t becomes large.
if (cid:9) is not small, the position becomes arbitrarily close to t
The “head start” of (cid:9) therefore doesn’t help you in the long run. ♣

5.28. Falling chain

First solution: The left part of the chain is in freefall (because we’re dealing with
a chain described by our first scenario), so at time t it is moving at speed gt and has
fallen a distance gt2/2. The chain gets doubled up below the support, so a length of
only gt2/4 hangs at rest. Hence, a length of L−gt2/4 is falling at speed gt. With upward
taken to be positive, the momentum of the entire chain (which just comes from the
moving part, of course) is therefore

p = σ (L − gt2/4)(−gt) = −σ Lgt + σ g2t3/4.

(5.180)

If Fs is the force from the support, then the net force on the entire chain is Fs − σ Lg.
So F = dp/dt for the entire chain gives

Fs − σ Lg = d

4L/g ).
This result holds until the top of the chain has fallen a distance 2L (at T =
Prior to time T , Fs equals three times the weight, σ (gt2/4)g, of the part of the chain
that hangs at rest. After time T , Fs simply equals the total weight of the chain, σ Lg.
So at time T , Fs abruptly drops from 3σ Lg to σ Lg.
Second solution: Fs is responsible for two things: (1) It holds up the part of the chain
that hangs at rest below the support, and (2) it changes the momentum of the atoms
in the chain that are suddenly brought to rest at the kink in the chain. In other words,
Fs = Fweight + Fdp/dt. From the first solution above, we have Fweight = σ (gt2/4)g.
Now let’s find Fdp/dt. At time t, the speed of the chain is gt, so in a small time interval
dt, the top of the chain falls a distance (gt) dt. But due to the “doubling up” effect, only
half of this length is brought to rest in the time dt. Therefore, a small piece of mass
σ (1/2)(gt) dt that was moving at speed gt is suddenly brought to rest. The momentum
was (σ/2)(gt)2dt downward, and then it becomes zero. Hence, dp = +(σ/2)g2t2dt,
and so Fdp/dt = dp/dt = (σ/2)g2t2. Therefore,

Fs = Fweight + Fdp/dt =

5.29. Falling chain (energy conserving)

Let σ be the mass density of the chain, let L be its total length, and let x be the distance
(defined to be positive) that the top of the chain has fallen. For a given x, a piece
of chain with mass σ x and CM position L − x/2 has effectively been replaced by a
thin “U” below the support, with height x/2; so its CM position is −x/4. The loss in
potential energy is therefore (σ x)g(L − x/2) − (σ x)g(−x/4) = σ xg(L − x/4). Since

5.11 Solutions

213

we are assuming that energy is conserved in this setup, this loss in potential energy
shows up as the gain in kinetic energy of the moving part of the chain. This part has
length L − x/2 (because x/2 is the length hanging below the support), so conservation
of energy gives

σ (L − x/2)v2 = σ xg(L − x/4) =⇒ v =

(5.183)

This has the expected property of going to infinity for x → 2L. However, the finite
size of the bend becomes relevant when x approaches 2L, so all of the energy never
ends up being concentrated in an infinitely small piece. All speeds therefore remain
finite, as they must.

L/g, we see that the time in the present energy-conserving
case is about 0.847 times the time in the freefall case.

√

To find the tension T at the left end of the bend, let’s paint a little dot on the chain
there. We’ll find the acceleration of the falling part above the dot and then use F = ma.
The acceleration of the falling part is a = dv/dt, where v is given in Eq. (5.183). Taking
the derivative, you can show (don’t forget the dx/dt from the chain rule) that a can be
written in the form,

a = g

The F = ma equation for the part of the chain above the dot, with downward taken to

we have

T = σ (L − x/2)g

where we have used Eq. (5.183). This has the expected properties of equaling zero
when x = 0 and diverging when x → 2L.

To find the tension at the right end of the bend, note that the total upward tension on
the tiny bend equals the rate of change in momentum of the bend (the gravitational force
is negligible). In a small time dt, a length v dt/2 of chain is brought to rest (the factor
of 2 comes from the doubling-up effect). This length goes from moving downward at
speed v to being at rest, so the change in momentum is σ (v dt/2)v upward. Therefore,
dp/dt = σ v2/2. This must be the total upward force on the bend, and since we found
above that the upward force at the left end is σ v2/4, there must also be an upward force
at the right end of σ v2/4. The tensions at the two ends are therefore equal.

5.30. Falling from a table

(a) First solution: Let σ be the mass density of the chain. From conservation of
energy, we know that the chain’s final kinetic energy, which is (σ L)v2/2, equals
the loss in potential energy. This loss equals (σ L)(L/2)g, because the center of
mass falls a distance L/2. Therefore,

(cid:4)

v =

gL .

(5.187)

This equals the speed obtained by an object that falls a distance L/2. Note that
if the initial piece hanging down through the hole is arbitrarily short, then the

214

Conservation of energy and momentum

chain will take an arbitrarily long time to fall down. But the final speed will still
be (arbitrarily close to)

gL.

√

Second solution: Let x be the length that hangs down through the hole. The
gravitational force on this length, which is (σ x)g, is responsible for changing
the momentum of the entire chain, which is (σ L)˙x. Therefore, F = dp/dt gives
(σ x)g = (σ L)¨x, which is simply the F = ma equation. Hence, ¨x = (g/L)x, and
the general solution to this equation is34

x(t) = Aet

(5.188)
Let T be the time for which x(T ) = L. If (cid:9) is very small, then T will be very
large. But for large t (more precisely, for t (cid:6)
L/g ), we may neglect the
negative-exponent term in Eq. (5.188). We then have

(5.189)

(5.190)

in agreement with the first solution.

(b) Let σ be the mass density of the chain, and let x be the length that hangs down
through the hole. The gravitational force on this length, which is (σ x)g, is
responsible for changing the momentum of the chain. This momentum is (σ x)˙x,
because only the hanging part is moving. Therefore, F = dp/dt gives

xg = x¨x + ˙x2.
(5.191)
Note that F = ma gives the wrong equation, because it neglects the fact that the
amount of moving mass, σ x, is changing. It therefore misses the second term on
the right-hand side of Eq. (5.191). In short, the momentum of the chain increases
because it is speeding up (which gives the x¨x term) and because additional mass
is continually being added to the moving part (which gives the ˙x2 term, as you
can show).

Let’s now solve Eq. (5.191) for x(t). Since g is the only parameter in the
equation, the solution for x(t) can involve only g’s and t’s.35 By dimensional
analysis, x(t) must then be of the form x(t) = bgt2, where b is a numerical
constant to be determined. Plugging this expression for x(t) into Eq. (5.191) and
dividing by g2t2 gives b = 2b2 + 4b2. Therefore, b = 1/6, and our solution
may be written as

(cid:7)

(cid:8)

x(t) = 1

This is the equation for something that accelerates downward with acceleration
g(cid:16) = g/3. The time the chain takes to fall a distance L is then given by L =
g(cid:16)t2/2, which yields t =

2L/g(cid:16). The final speed is thus

cannot appear in the solution. Also, the initial position and speed (which in general appear in the
solution for x(t), because Eq. (5.191) is a second-order differential equation) do not appear in this
case, because they are equal to zero.

5.11 Solutions

215

√

This is smaller than the
gL result in part (a). We therefore see that although
the total time for the scenario in part (a) is very large, the final speed in that case
is in fact larger than that in the present scenario. You can show that the speed in
part (a)’s scenario is smaller than the speed in part (b)’s scenario for x less than
2L/3, but larger for x greater than 2L/3.

Remarks: Using Eq. (5.193), you can show that 1/3 of the available potential
energy is lost to heat. This inevitable loss occurs during the abrupt motions that
suddenly bring the atoms from zero to nonzero speed when they join the moving
part of the chain. The use of conservation of energy is therefore not a valid way
to solve part (b). If you used conservation of energy, you would (as you can
verify) obtain an incorrect acceleration of g/2. In view of the above solution
based on F = dp/dt, this g/2 result cannot be correct, because there is simply
not enough downward force in the setup to yield this acceleration. The only
downward force comes from gravity, and we showed above that this leads to an
acceleration of g/3.

If we want to try to get rid of the energy loss and somehow produce an
acceleration of g/2, a plausible idea is to use a continuous piece of rope instead
of the ideal kind of chain we’ve been using. As mentioned near the end of Section
5.8, a rope yields an energy-conserving system. However, from the reasoning on
page 171, there is now a nonzero tension everywhere throughout the rope, even
in the part inside the heap; this is the price we pay for having none of the points
in the rope abruptly go from zero to nonzero speed. This tension then causes the
rope (all of it) in the heap to move. The system is therefore completely different
from the original one with our ideal chain, where it was understood that all the
little strings connecting the ideal point masses in the heap are initially limp with
zero tension; the tension in a given little string becomes nonzero only when it
joins the moving part of the chain. The solution to this new energy-conserving
setup therefore depends on exactly how the rope in the heap is initially situated;
more information is therefore needed to solve the problem. But one thing is
certain: this new setup is definitely not going to yield an acceleration of g/2,
because the conservation-of-energy solution that leads to g/2 is based on the
assumption that the entire loss in potential energy goes exclusively into the gain
in kinetic energy of the part of the rope that has fallen below the table. The fact
that the rope inside the heap is now also moving ruins this assumption. ♣

5.31. The raindrop

Let ρ be the mass density of the raindrop, and let λ be the average mass density in
space of the water droplets. Let r(t), M (t), and v(t) be the radius, mass, and velocity of
the raindrop, respectively. We need three equations to solve for these three unknowns.
The equations we will use are two different expressions for dM/dt, and the F = dp/dt
˙M is obtained by taking the
expression for the raindrop. The first expression for
derivative of M = (4/3)πr3ρ, which gives

˙M = 4πr2 ˙rρ

= 3M

˙r
r

.

(5.194)

(5.195)

The second expression for ˙M is obtained by noting that the change in M is due to the
acquisition of water droplets. The raindrop sweeps out volume at a rate given by its
cross-sectional area times its velocity. Therefore,
˙M = πr2vλ.
(5.196)
The F = dp/dt equation is found as follows. The gravitational force is Mg, and the
momentum is M v. Therefore, F = dp/dt gives

Mg = ˙M v + M ˙v.

(5.197)

216

Conservation of energy and momentum

We now have three equations involving the three unknowns, r, M, and v.36 Our goal

Therefore,

˜gr = 12˙r2 + 4r¨r,
(5.201)
where we have defined ˜g ≡ gλ/ρ, for convenience. The only parameter in Eq. (5.201)
is ˜g. Therefore, r(t) can depend only on ˜g and t.37 Hence, by dimensional analysis, r
must take the form

r(t) = A ˜gt2,

(5.202)

where A is a numerical constant, to be determined. Plugging this expression for r into
Eq. (5.201) gives

˜g(A ˜gt2) = 12(2A ˜gt)2 + 4(A ˜gt2)(2A ˜g)

=⇒ A = 48A2 + 8A2.

(5.203)
Therefore, A = 1/56, and so ¨r = 2A ˜g = ˜g/28 = gλ/28ρ. Eq. (5.199) then gives the
acceleration of the raindrop as

˙v = g
7

,

(5.204)

independent of ρ and λ. For further discussion of the raindrop problem, see Krane
(1981).

Remark: A common invalid solution to this problem is the following, which (incor-
rectly) uses conservation of energy: The fact that v is proportional to ˙r (shown in Eq.
(5.198)) means that the volume swept out by the raindrop is a cone. The center of mass
of a cone is 1/4 of the way from the base to the apex (as you can show by integrating
over horizontal circular slices). Therefore, if M is the mass of the raindrop after it has
fallen a height h, then an (incorrect) application of conservation of energy gives

(incorrect).

(5.205)

(5.206)

36 Note that we cannot write down the naive conservation-of-energy equation (which would say that
the decrease in the water’s potential energy equals the increase in its kinetic energy), because
mechanical energy is not conserved. The collisions between the raindrop and the droplets are
completely inelastic. The raindrop will, in fact, heat up. See the remark at the end of the solution.
37 The other dimensionful quantities in the problem, ρ and λ, do not appear in Eq. (5.201), except
through ˜g, so they cannot appear in the solution. Also, the initial values of r and ˙r (which in
general appear in the solution for r(t), because Eq. (5.201) is a second-order differential equation)
do not appear in this case, because they are equal to zero.

5.11 Solutions

217

The reason why this solution is invalid is that the collisions between the raindrop and
the droplets are completely inelastic. Heat is generated, and the overall kinetic energy
of the raindrop is smaller than you would otherwise expect.

Let’s calculate how much mechanical energy is lost (and therefore how much the
raindrop heats up) as a function of the height fallen. The loss in mechanical energy is

(5.207)

(5.208)

where (cid:16)Eint is the gain in internal thermal energy. The energy required to heat 1 g of
water by 1 ◦C is 1 calorie (= 4.18 joules). Therefore, the energy required to heat 1 kg
of water by 1 ◦C is ≈ 4200 J. In other words,

(cid:16)Eint = 4200 M (cid:16)T ,

(5.209)

where M is measured in kilograms, and T is measured in degrees Celsius. Equations
(5.208) and (5.209) give the increase in temperature as a function of h,

gh.

(5.210)

How far must the raindrop fall before it starts to boil? If we assume that the water
droplets’ temperature is near freezing, then the height through which the raindrop
must fall to have (cid:16)T = 100 ◦C is found from Eq. (5.210) to be

h ≈ 400 000 m = 400 km,

(5.211)

which is much larger than the height of the atmosphere. We have, of course, idealized
the problem in a drastic manner. But needless to say, there is no need to worry about
getting burned by the rain. A typical value for h is a few kilometers, which would raise
the temperature by only about one degree. This effect is completely washed out by
many other factors. ♣

Chapter 6
The Lagrangian method

In this chapter, we’re going to learn about a whole new way of looking at things.
Consider the system of a mass on the end of a spring. We can analyze this, of
course, by using F = ma to write down m¨x = −kx. The solutions to this equation
are sinusoidal functions, as we well know. We can, however, figure things out
by using another method which doesn’t explicitly use F = ma. In many (in
fact, probably most) physical situations, this new method is far superior to using
F = ma. You will soon discover this for yourself when you tackle the problems
and exercises for this chapter. We will present our new method by first stating its
rules (without any justification) and showing that they somehow end up magically
giving the correct answer. We will then give the method proper justification.

6.1 The Euler–Lagrange equations

Here is the procedure. Consider the following seemingly silly combination of the
kinetic and potential energies (T and V, respectively),

L ≡ T − V .

(6.1)

This is called the Lagrangian. Yes, there is a minus sign in the definition (a plus
sign would simply give the total energy). In the problem of a mass on the end of
a spring, T = m˙x2/2 and V = kx2/2, so we have

(6.3)

Don’t worry, we’ll show you in Section 6.2 where this comes from. This equation
is called the Euler–Lagrange (E–L) equation. For the problem at hand, we have
∂L/∂ ˙x = m˙x and ∂L/∂x = −kx (see Appendix B for the definition of a partial
derivative), so Eq. (6.3) gives

m¨x = −kx,

(6.4)

218

6.1 The Euler–Lagrange equations

219

which is exactly the result obtained by using F = ma. An equation such as
Eq. (6.4), which is derived from the Euler–Lagrange equation, is called an
equation of motion.1 If the problem involves more than one coordinate, as most
problems do, we just have to apply Eq. (6.3) to each coordinate. We will obtain
as many equations as there are coordinates. Each equation may very well involve
many of the coordinates (see the example below, where both equations involve
both x and θ).

At this point, you may be thinking, “That was a nice little trick, but we just
got lucky in the spring problem. The procedure won’t work in a more general
situation.” Well, let’s see. How about if we consider the more general problem
of a particle moving in an arbitrary potential V (x) (we’ll stick to one dimension
for now). The Lagrangian is then

L = 1
2

m˙x2 − V (x),

and the Euler–Lagrange equation, Eq. (6.3), gives

m¨x = − dV
dx

.

(6.5)

(6.6)

But −dV /dx is the force on the particle. So we see that Eqs. (6.1) and (6.3)
together say exactly the same thing that F = ma says, when using a Cartesian
coordinate in one dimension (but this result is in fact quite general, as we’ll see
in Section 6.4). Note that shifting the potential by a given constant has no effect
on the equation of motion, because Eq. (6.3) involves only the derivative of V .
This is equivalent to saying that only differences in energy are relevant, and not
the actual values, as we well know.

In a three-dimensional setup written in terms of Cartesian coordinates, the

potential takes the form V (x, y, z), so the Lagrangian is

L = 1
2

m(˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2) − V (x, y, z).

(6.7)

It then immediately follows that the three Euler–Lagrange equations (obtained
by applying Eq. (6.3) to x, y, and z) may be combined into the vector statement,

m¨x = −∇V .

(6.8)

But −∇V = F, so we again arrive at Newton’s second law, F = ma, now in
three dimensions.

Let’s do one more example to convince you that there’s really something

nontrivial going on here.

1 The term “equation of motion” is a little ambiguous. It is understood to refer to the second-order
differential equation satisfied by x, and not the actual equation for x as a function of t, namely
x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ) in this problem, which is obtained by integrating the equation of motion
twice.

Example (Spring pendulum): Consider a pendulum made of a spring with a
mass m on the end (see Fig. 6.1). The spring is arranged to lie in a straight line
(which we can arrange by, say, wrapping the spring around a rigid massless rod). The
equilibrium length of the spring is (cid:2). Let the spring have length (cid:2) + x(t), and let its
angle with the vertical be θ(t). Assuming that the motion takes place in a vertical
plane, find the equations of motion for x and θ.

parts, so we have

The potential energy comes from both gravity and the spring, so we have

There are two variables here, x and θ. As mentioned above, the nice thing about the
Lagrangian method is that we can just use Eq. (6.3) twice, once with x and once with
θ . So the two Euler–Lagrange equations are

=⇒ m((cid:2) + x) ¨θ + 2m˙x ˙θ = −mg sin θ.

(6.13)

Equation (6.12) is simply the radial F = ma equation, complete with the centripetal
acceleration, −((cid:2) + x) ˙θ 2. And the first line of Eq. (6.13) is the statement that the
torque equals the rate of change of the angular momentum (this is one of the sub-
jects of Chapter 8). Alternatively, if you want to work in a rotating reference frame,
then Eq. (6.12) is the radial F = ma equation, complete with the centrifugal force,
m((cid:2) + x) ˙θ 2. And the third line of Eq. (6.13) is the tangential F = ma equation,
complete with the Coriolis force, −2m˙x ˙θ. But never mind about this now. We’ll deal
with rotating frames in Chapter 10.2

2 Throughout this chapter, I’ll occasionally point out torques, angular momenta, centrifugal forces,
and other such things when they pop up in equations of motion, even though we haven’t covered

6.2 The principle of stationary action

Remark: After writing down the E–L equations, it is always best to double-check them by
trying to identify them as F = ma and/or τ = dL/dt equations (once we learn about that).
Sometimes, however, this identification isn’t obvious. And for the times when everything
is clear (that is, when you look at the E–L equations and say, “Oh, of course!”), it is usually
clear only after you’ve derived the equations. In general, the safest method for solving
a problem is to use the Lagrangian method and then double-check things with F = ma
and/or τ = dL/dt if you can. ♣

At this point it seems to be personal preference, and all academic, whether you
use the Lagrangian method or the F = ma method. The two methods produce
the same equations. However, in problems involving more than one variable, it
usually turns out to be much easier to write down T and V , as opposed to writing
down all the forces. This is because T and V are nice and simple scalars. The
forces, on the other hand, are vectors, and it is easy to get confused if they point
in various directions. The Lagrangian method has the advantage that once you’ve
written down L ≡ T − V , you don’t have to think anymore. All you have to do
is blindly take some derivatives.3

When jumping from high in a tree,
Just write down del L by del z.
Take del L by z dot,
Then t-dot what you’ve got,
And equate the results (but quickly!)

But ease of computation aside, is there any fundamental difference between the
two methods? Is there any deep reasoning behind Eq. (6.3)? Indeed, there is …

6.2 The principle of stationary action

Consider the quantity,

S ≡

(cid:14)

t2

t1

L(x, ˙x, t)dt.

(6.14)

S is called the action. It is a quantity with the dimensions of (Energy)×(Time). S
depends on L, and L in turn depends on the function x(t) via Eq. (6.1).4 Given any

them yet. I figure it can’t hurt to bring your attention to them. But rest assured, a familiarity with
these topics is by no means necessary for an understanding of what we’ll be doing in this chapter,
so just ignore the references if you want. One of the great things about the Lagrangian method is
that even if you’ve never heard of the terms “torque,” “centrifugal,” “Coriolis,” or even “F = ma”
itself, you can still get the correct equations by simply writing down the kinetic and potential
energies, and then taking a few derivatives.

3 Well, you eventually have to solve the resulting equations of motion, but you have to do that with

the F = ma method, too.

4 In some situations, the kinetic and potential energies in L ≡ T − V may explicitly depend on time,

so we have included the “t” in Eq. (6.14).

function x(t), we can produce the quantity S. We’ll deal with only one coordinate,
x, for now.

Integrals like the one in Eq. (6.14) are called functionals, and S is sometimes
denoted by S[x(t)]. It depends on the entire function x(t), and not on just one
input number, as a regular function f (t) does. S can be thought of as a function
of an infinite number of values, namely all the x(t) for t ranging from t1 to t2. If
you don’t like infinities, you can imagine breaking up the time interval into, say,
a million pieces, and then replacing the integral by a discrete sum.

Let’s now pose the following question: Consider a function x(t), for t1 ≤
t ≤ t2, which has its endpoints fixed (that is, x(t1) = x1 and x(t2) = x2,
where x1 and x2 are given), but is otherwise arbitrary. What function x(t) yields
a stationary value of S? A stationary value is a local minimum, maximum, or
saddle point.5

For example, consider a ball dropped from rest, and consider the function
y(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Assume that we somehow know that y(0) = 0 and
y(1) = −g/2. 6 A number of possibilities for y(t) are shown in Fig. 6.2, and
each of these can (in theory) be plugged into Eqs. (6.1) and (6.14) to generate S.
Which one yields a stationary value of S? The following theorem gives us the
answer.

Theorem 6.1 If the function x0(t) yields a stationary value (that is, a local
minimum, maximum, or saddle point) of S, then

(cid:3)

(6.15)

It is understood that we are considering the class of functions whose endpoints
are fixed. That is, x(t1) = x1 and x(t2) = x2.

Proof: We will use the fact that if a certain function x0(t) yields a stationary
value of S, then any other function very close to x0(t) (with the same endpoint
values) yields essentially the same S, up to first order in any deviations. This is
actually the definition of a stationary value. The analogy with regular functions
is that if f (b) is a stationary value of f , then f (b + (cid:9)) differs from f (b) only at
second order in the small quantity (cid:9). This is true because f (cid:16)(b) = 0, so there is
no first-order term in the Taylor series expansion around b.

Assume that the function x0(t) yields a stationary value of S, and consider the

function

xa(t) ≡ x0(t) + aβ(t),

(6.16)

5 A saddle point is a point where there are no first-order changes in S, and where some of the
second-order changes are positive and some are negative (like the middle of a saddle, of course).

6 This follows from y = −gt2/2, but pretend that we don’t know this formula.

6.2 The principle of stationary action

223

where a is a number, and where β(t) satisfies β(t1) = β(t2) = 0 (to keep the
endpoints of the function fixed), but is otherwise arbitrary. When producing the
action S[xa(t)] in (6.14), the t is integrated out, so S is just a number. It depends
on a, in addition to t1 and t2. Our requirement is that there be no change in S at
first order in a. How does S depend on a? Using the chain rule, we have

In other words, a influences S through its effect on x, and also through its effect
on ˙x. From Eq. (6.16), we have

and

∂ ˙xa

(6.21)

But β(t1) = β(t2) = 0, so the last term (the “boundary term”) vanishes. We now
use the fact that (∂/∂a)S[xa(t)] must be zero for any function β(t), because we
are assuming that x0(t) yields a stationary value. The only way this can be true
is if the quantity in parentheses above (evaluated at a = 0) is identically equal to
zero, that is,

7 Note that nowhere do we assume that xa and ˙xa are independent variables. The partial derivatives
in Eq. (6.18) are very much related, in that one is the derivative of the other. The use of the chain
rule in Eq. (6.17) is still perfectly valid.

224

The Lagrangian method

The E–L equation, Eq. (6.3), therefore doesn’t just come out of the blue. It
is a consequence of requiring that the action be at a stationary value. We may
therefore replace F = ma by the following principle.

• The principle of stationary action:

The path of a particle is the one that yields a stationary value of the action.

This principle (also known as Hamilton’s principle) is equivalent to F = ma
because the above theorem shows that if (and only if, as you can show by working
backwards) we have a stationary value of S, then the E–L equations hold. And the
E–L equations are equivalent to F = ma (as we showed for Cartesian coordinates
in Section 6.1, and as we’ll prove for any coordinate system in Section 6.4).
Therefore, “stationary action” is equivalent to F = ma.

If we have a multidimensional setup where the Lagrangian is a function of the
variables x1(t), x2(t), . . . , then the above principle of stationary action is still all
we need. With more than one variable, we can now vary the path by varying each
coordinate (or combinations thereof). The variation of each coordinate produces
an E–L equation which, as we saw in the Cartesian case, is equivalent to an
F = ma equation.

Given a classical mechanics problem, we can solve it with F = ma, or we
can solve it with the E–L equations, which are a consequence of the principle of
stationary action (often called the principle of “least action” or “minimal action,”
but see the fourth remark below). Either method will get the job done. But as
mentioned at the end of Section 6.1, it is often easier to use the latter, because it
avoids the use of force which can get confusing if you have forces pointing in all
sorts of complicated directions.

It just stood there and did nothing, of course,
A harmless and still wooden horse.
But the minimal action
Was just a distraction;
The plan involved no use of force.

Let’s now return to the example of a ball dropped from rest, mentioned above.
The Lagrangian is L = T − V = m˙y2/2 − mgy, so Eq. (6.22) gives ¨y = −g,
which is simply the F = ma equation (divided through by m), as expected. The
solution is y(t) = −gt2/2 + v0t + y0, as we well know. But the initial conditions
tell us that v0 = y0 = 0, so our solution is y(t) = −gt2/2. You are encouraged
to verify explicitly that this y(t) yields an action that is stationary with respect
to variations of the form, say, y(t) = −gt2/2 + (cid:9)t(t − 1), which also satisfies
the endpoint conditions (this is the task of Exercise 6.30). There is, of course,
an infinite number of other ways to vary y(t), but this specific result should help
convince you of the validity of Theorem 6.1.

Note that the stationarity implied by the Euler–Lagrange equation, Eq. (6.22),
is a local statement. It gives information only about nearby paths. It says nothing

6.2 The principle of stationary action

225

about the global nature of how the action depends on all possible paths. If we find
that a solution to Eq. (6.22) happens to produce a local minimum (as opposed to a
maximum or a saddle), there is no reason to conclude that it is a global minimum,
although in many cases it turns out to be (see Exercise 6.32, for the case of a
thrown ball).

Remarks:

1. Theorem 6.1 is based on the assumption that the ending time, t2, of the motion is given.
But how do we know this final time? Well, we don’t. In the example of a ball thrown
upward, the total time to rise and fall back to your hand can be anything, depending on the
ball’s initial speed. This initial speed will show up as an integration constant when solving
the E–L equations. The motion must end sometime, and the principle of stationary action
says that for whatever time this happens to be, the physical path has a stationary action.
2. Theorem 6.1 shows that we can explain the E–L equations by the principle of stationary
action. This, however, simply shifts the burden of proof. We are now left with the task
of justifying why we should want the action to have a stationary value. The good news
is that there is a very solid reason for this. The bad news is that the reason involves
quantum mechanics, so we won’t be able to discuss it properly here. Suffice it to say that
a particle actually takes all possible paths in going from one place to another, and each
path is associated with the complex number eiS/(cid:1) (where (cid:1) = 1.05 · 10−34 J s is Planck’s
constant). These complex numbers have absolute value 1 and are called “phases.” It turns
out that the phases from all possible paths must be added up to give the “amplitude” of
going from one point to another. The absolute value of the amplitude must then be squared
to obtain the probability.8

The basic point, then, is that at a nonstationary value of S, the phases from different
paths differ (greatly, because (cid:1) is so small compared with the typical size of the action for
a macroscopic particle) from one another, which effectively leads to the addition of many
random vectors in the complex plane. These end up canceling each other, yielding a sum
of essentially zero. There is therefore no contribution to the overall amplitude from non-
stationary values of S. Hence, we do not observe the paths associated with these S’s. At a
stationary value of S, however, all the phases take on essentially the same value, thereby
adding constructively instead of destructively. There is therefore a nonzero probability
for the particle to take a path that yields a stationary value of S. So this is the path we
observe.

3. But again, the preceding remark simply shifts the burden of proof one step further. We
must now justify why these phases eiS/(cid:1) should exist, and why the Lagrangian that appears
in S should equal T − V . But here’s where we’re going to stop.

4. The principle of stationary action is sometimes referred to as the principle of “least”
action, but this is misleading. True, it is often the case that the stationary value turns out to
be a minimum value, but it need not be, as we can see in the following example. Consider
a harmonic oscillator which has a Lagrangian equal to

L = 1
2

m˙x2 − 1
2

kx2.

(6.23)

Let x0(t) be a function that yields a stationary value of the action. Then we know that
x0(t) satisfies the E–L equation, m¨x0 = −kx0. Consider a slight variation on this path,

8 This is one of those remarks that is completely useless, because it is incomprehensible to those
who haven’t seen the topic before, and trivial to those who have. My apologies. But this and the
following remarks are definitely not necessary for an understanding of the material in this chapter.
If you’re interested in reading more about these quantum mechanical issues, you should take a
look at Richard Feynman’s book (Feynman, 2006). Feynman was, after all, the one who thought
of this idea.

The first term is zero, due to the boundary conditions on ξ(t). The second term is zero,
due to the E–L equation. We’ve basically just reproduced the proof of Theorem 6.1 for
the special case of the harmonic oscillator here.

The terms in Eq. (6.24) involving only x0 give the stationary value of the action
(call it S0). To determine whether S0 is a minimum, maximum, or saddle point, we
must look at the difference,

(cid:16)S ≡ Sξ − S0 = 1

(cid:14)

(m ˙ξ 2 − kξ 2) dt.

(6.26)

It is always possible to find a function ξ that makes (cid:16)S positive. Simply choose ξ to be
small, but make it wiggle very fast, so that ˙ξ is large. Therefore, it is never the case that
S0 is a maximum. Note that this reasoning works for any potential, not just a harmonic
oscillator, as long as it is a function of position only (that is, it contains no derivatives, as
we always assume).

You might be tempted to use the same line of reasoning to say that it is also always
possible to find a function ξ that makes (cid:16)S negative, by making ξ large and ˙ξ small.
If this were true, then we could put everything together and conclude that all stationary
points are saddle points, for a harmonic oscillator. However, it is not always possible to
make ξ large enough and ˙ξ small enough so that (cid:16)S is negative, due to the boundary
conditions ξ(t1) = ξ(t2) = 0. If ξ changes from zero to a large value and then back to
zero, then ˙ξ may also have to be large, if the time interval is short enough. Problem 6.6
deals quantitatively with this issue. For now, let’s just recognize that in some cases S0 is
a minimum, in some cases it is a saddle point, and it is never a maximum. “Least action”
is therefore a misnomer.

5. It is sometimes said that nature has a “purpose,” in that it seeks to take the path that
produces the minimum action. In view of the second remark above, this is incorrect.
In fact, nature does exactly the opposite. It takes every path, treating them all on equal
footing. We end up seeing only the path with a stationary action, due to the way the
quantum mechanical phases add. It would be a harsh requirement, indeed, to demand
that nature make a “global” decision (that is, compare paths that are separated by large
distances) and choose the one with the smallest action. Instead, we see that everything
takes place on a “local” scale. Nearby phases simply add, and everything works out
automatically.

When an archer shoots an arrow through the air, the aim is made possible by all the other
arrows taking all the other nearby paths, each with essentially the same action. Likewise,
when you walk down the street with a certain destination in mind, you’re not alone . . .

When walking, I know that my aim

And although I can’t see
Where they walk next to me,
I know they’re all there, just the same.

6.3 Forces of constraint

227

6. Consider a function, f (x), of one variable (for ease of terminology). Let f (b) be a local
minimum of f . There are two basic properties of this minimum. The first is that f (b)
is smaller than all nearby values. The second is that the slope of f
is zero at b. From
the above remarks, we see that (as far as the action S is concerned) the first property is
completely irrelevant, and the second one is the whole point. In other words, saddle points
(and maxima, although we showed above that these never exist for S) are just as good as
minima, as far as the constructive addition of the eiS/(cid:1) phases is concerned.

7. Given that classical mechanics is an approximate theory, while quantum mechanics is
the (more) correct one, it is quite silly to justify the principle of stationary action by
demonstrating its equivalence to F = ma, as we did above. We should be doing it the
other way around. However, because our intuition is based on F = ma, it’s easier to start
with F = ma as the given fact, rather than calling upon the latent quantum-mechanical
intuition hidden deep within all of us. Maybe someday …

At any rate, in more advanced theories dealing with fundamental issues concerning the
tiny building blocks of matter (where actions are of the same order of magnitude as (cid:1)),
the approximate F = ma theory is invalid, and you have to use the Lagrangian method.
8. When dealing with a system in which a nonconservative force such as friction is present,
the Lagrangian method loses much of its appeal. The reason for this is that nonconservative
forces don’t have a potential energy associated with them, so there isn’t a specific V (x) that
you can write down in the Lagrangian. Although friction forces can in fact be incorporated
in the Lagrangian method, you have to include them in the E–L equations essentially by
hand. We won’t deal with nonconservative forces in this chapter. ♣

6.3 Forces of constraint

A nice thing about the Lagrangian method is that we are free to impose any given
constraints at the beginning of the problem, thereby immediately reducing the
number of variables. This is always done (perhaps without thinking) whenever
a particle is constrained to move on a wire or surface, etc. Often we are con-
cerned not with the exact nature of the forces doing the constraining, but only
with the resulting motion, given that the constraints hold. By imposing the con-
straints at the outset, we can find the motion, but we can’t say anything about the
constraining forces.

If we want to determine the constraining forces, we must take a different
approach. The main idea of the strategy, as we will show below, is that we must
not impose the constraints too soon. This leaves us with a larger number of
variables to deal with, so the calculations are more cumbersome. But the benefit
is that we are able to find the constraining forces.

Consider the setup of a particle sliding off a fixed frictionless hemisphere of
radius R (see Fig. 6.3). Let’s say that we are concerned only with finding the
equation of motion for θ, and not the constraining force. Then we can write
everything in terms of θ, because we know that the radial distance r is cons-
trained to be R. The kinetic energy is mR2 ˙θ 2/2, and the potential energy (relative
to the bottom of the hemisphere) is mgR cos θ, so the Lagrangian is

L = 1
2

mR2 ˙θ 2 − mgR cos θ,

(6.27)

R

θ

Fig. 6.3

228

The Lagrangian method

and the equation of motion, via Eq. (6.3), is

¨θ = (g/R) sin θ,

(6.28)

which is equivalent to the tangential F = ma statement.

Now let’s say that we want to find the constraining normal force that the
hemisphere applies to the particle. To do this, let’s solve the problem in a different
way and write things in terms of both r and θ. Also (and here’s the critical step),
let’s be really picky and say that r isn’t exactly constrained to be R, because in
the real world the particle actually sinks into the hemisphere a little bit. This may
seem a bit silly, but it’s really the whole point. The particle pushes and sinks
inward a tiny distance until the hemisphere gets squashed enough to push back
with the appropriate force to keep the particle from sinking in any more (just
consider the hemisphere to be made of lots of little springs with very large spring
constants). The particle is therefore subject to a (very steep) potential arising from
the hemisphere’s force. The constraining potential, V (r), looks something like
the plot in Fig. 6.4. The true Lagrangian for the system is thus

V(r)

r

R

L = 1
2

m(˙r2 + r2 ˙θ 2) − mgr cos θ − V (r).

(6.29)

Fig. 6.4

(The ˙r2 term in the kinetic energy will turn out to be insignificant.) The equa-
tions of motion obtained from varying θ and r are therefore

mr2 ¨θ + 2mr˙r ˙θ = mgr sin θ,

m¨r = mr ˙θ 2 − mg cos θ − V

(cid:16)(r).

(6.30)

Having written down the equations of motion, we will now apply the constraint
condition that r = R. This condition implies ˙r = ¨r = 0. (Of course, r isn’t really
equal to R, but any differences are inconsequential from this point onward.) The
first of Eqs. (6.30) then reproduces Eq. (6.28), while the second yields

− dV
dr

(cid:16)
(cid:16)
(cid:16)
(cid:16)
r=R

= mg cos θ − mR ˙θ 2.

(6.31)

But FN ≡ −dV /dr is the constraint force applied in the r direction, which is
precisely the force we are looking for. The normal force of constraint is therefore

FN(θ, ˙θ) = mg cos θ − mR ˙θ 2.

(6.32)

This is equivalent to the radial F = ma equation, mg cos θ − FN = mR ˙θ 2 (which
is certainly a quicker way to find the normal force in the present problem). Note
that this result is valid only if FN(θ, ˙θ) > 0. If the normal force becomes zero,
then this means that the particle has left the sphere, in which case r no longer
equals R.

6.4 Change of coordinates

Remarks:

1. What if we instead had (unwisely) chosen Cartesian coordinates, x and y, instead of polar
coordinates, r and θ? Since the distance from the particle to the surface of the hemisphere
is η ≡

x2 + y2 − R, we obtain a true Lagrangian equal to

(cid:4)

L = 1
2

m(˙x2 + ˙y2) − mgy − V (η).

The equations of motion are (using the chain rule)

and m¨y = −mg − dV

We now apply the constraint condition η = 0. Since −dV /dη equals the constraint force
F, you can show that the equations we end up with (namely, the two E–L equations and
the constraint equation) are

and

These three equations are sufficient to determine the three unknowns ¨x, ¨y, and F as
functions of the quantities x, ˙x, y, and ˙y. See Exercise 6.37, which should convince
you that polar coordinates are the way to go. In general, the strategy for solving for F
is to take two time derivatives of the constraint equation and then eliminate the second
derivatives of the coordinates by using the E–L equations (this process was trivial in the
polar-coordinate case).

(6.35)

2. You can see from Eq. (6.35) that the E–L equations end up taking the form,

(6.36)

for each coordinate qi. The quantity η is what appears in the constraint equation, η = 0.
In our hemisphere problem, we had η = r − R in polar coordinates, and η =
x2 + y2 −
R in Cartesian coordinates. The E–L equations, combined with the η = 0 condition,
give us exactly the number of equations (N + 1 of them, where N is the number of
coordinates) needed to determine all of the N + 1 unknowns (all the ¨qi, and F) in terms of
the qi and ˙qi.

(cid:4)

Writing down the equations in Eq. (6.36) is basically the method of Lagrange multipli-
ers, where the Lagrange multiplier turns out to be the force. But if you’re not familiar with
this method, no need to worry; you can derive everything from scratch using the above
technique involving the steep potential. If you do happen to be familiar with it, then there
might in fact be a need to worry about how you apply it, as the following remark explains.
3. When trying to determine the forces of constraint, you can just start with Eq. (6.36),
without bothering to write down V (η). But you must be careful to make sure that η does
indeed represent the distance the particle is from where it should be. In polar coordinates,
if someone gives you the constraint condition for the hemisphere as 7(r − R) = 0, and
if you use the left-hand side of this as the η in Eq. (6.36), then you will get the wrong
constraint force; it will be too small by a factor of 7. Likewise, in Cartesian coordinates,
R2 − x2 = 0 will give you the wrong force. The best way to
writing the constraint as y −
avoid this problem is, of course, to pick one of your variables as the distance the particle
is from where it should be (up to an additive constant, as in the case of r − R = 0). ♣

6.4 Change of coordinates

When L is written in terms of Cartesian coordinates x, y, z, we showed in Section
6.1 that the Euler–Lagrange equations are equivalent to Newton’s F = ma

230

The Lagrangian method

equations; see Eq. (6.8). But what about the case where we use polar, spherical,
or some other coordinates? The equivalence of the E–L equations and F = ma
isn’t so obvious. As far as trusting the E–L equations for such coordinates goes,
you can achieve peace of mind in two ways. You can accept the principle of
stationary action as something so beautiful and profound that it simply has to
work for any choice of coordinates. Or, you can take the more mundane road
and show through a change of coordinates that if the E–L equations hold for one
set of coordinates (and we know that they do hold for at least one set, namely
Cartesian coordinates), then they also hold for any other coordinates (of a certain
form, described below). In this section, we will demonstrate the validity of the
E–L equations through the explicit change of coordinates.9

Consider the set of coordinates,

xi :

(x1, x2, . . . , xN ).

(6.37)

For example, if N = 6, then x1, x2, x3 could be the Cartesian x, y, z coordinates
of one particle, and x4, x5, x6 could be the r, θ, φ polar coordinates of a second
particle, and so on. Assume that the E–L equations hold for these variables,
that is,

(1 ≤ i ≤ N ).

(6.38)

Consider a new set of variables that are functions of the xi and t,

qi = qi(x1, x2, . . . , xN ; t).

(6.39)

We will restrict ourselves to the case where the qi do not depend on the ˙xi. (This is
quite reasonable. If the coordinates depended on the velocities, then we wouldn’t
be able to label points in space with definite coordinates. We’d have to worry
about how the particles were behaving when they were at the points. These would
be strange coordinates indeed.) We can, in theory, invert Eq. (6.39) and express
the xi as functions of the qi and t,

xi = xi(q1, q2, . . . , qN ; t).

(6.40)

Claim 6.2 If Eq. (6.38) is true for the xi coordinates, and if the xi and qi are
related by Eq. (6.40), then Eq. (6.38) is also true for the qi coordinates. That is,

We have therefore demonstrated that if the Euler–Lagrange equations are true
for one set of coordinates, xi (and they are true for Cartesian coordinates), then

232

The Lagrangian method

they are also true for any other set of coordinates, qi, satisfying Eq. (6.39). If
you’re inclined to look at the principle of stationary action with distrust, thinking
that it might be a coordinate-dependent statement, this proof should put you at
ease. The Euler–Lagrange equations are valid in any coordinates.

Note that the above proof did not in any way use the precise form of the
Lagrangian. If L were equal to T + V, or 8T + πV 2/T , or any other arbitrary
function, our result would still be true: If Eq. (6.38) is true for one set of coordi-
nates, then it is also true for any other set of coordinates qi satisfying Eq. (6.39).
The point is that the only L for which the hypothesis is true at all (that is, for
which Eq. (6.38) holds) is L ≡ T − V (or any constant multiple of this).

Remark: On one hand, it is quite amazing how little we assumed in proving the above claim.
Any new coordinates of the very general form in Eq. (6.39) satisfy the E–L equations, as long
as the original coordinates do. If the E–L equations had, say, a factor of 5 on the right-hand
side of Eq. (6.38), then they would not hold in arbitrary coordinates. To see this, just follow
the proof through with the factor of 5.

On the other hand, the claim is quite believable, if you make an analogy with a function
instead of a functional. Consider the function f (z) = z2. This has a minimum at z = 0,
consistent with the fact that df /dz = 0 at z = 0. But let’s now write f in terms of the variable
y defined by, say, z = y4. Then f (y) = y8, and f has a minimum at y = 0, consistent with the
fact that df /dy = 0 at y = 0. So f (cid:16) = 0 holds in both coordinates at the corresponding points
y = z = 0. This is the (simplified) analog of the E–L equations holding in both coordinates. In
both cases, the derivative equation describes where the stationary value occurs.

This change-of-variables result may be stated in a more geometrical (and friendly) way. If
you plot a function and then stretch the horizontal axis in an arbitrary manner (which is what
happens when you change coordinates), then a stationary value (that is, one where the slope is
zero) will still be a stationary value after the stretching.10 A picture (or even just the thought of
one) is worth a dozen equations, apparently.

As an example of an equation that does not hold for all coordinates, consider the preceding
example, but with f (cid:16) = 1 instead of f (cid:16) = 0. In terms of z, f (cid:16) = 1 when z = 1/2. And in terms
of y, f (cid:16) = 1 when y = (1/8)1/7. But the points z = 1/2 and y = (1/8)1/7 are not the same
point. In other words, f (cid:16) = 1 is not a coordinate-independent statement. Most equations are
coordinate dependent. The special thing about f (cid:16) = 0 is that a stationary point is a stationary
point no matter how you look at it. ♣

6.5 Conservation laws

6.5.1 Cyclic coordinates

Consider the case where the Lagrangian does not depend on a certain coordinate
qk . Then

∂L
∂ ˙qk

=

∂L
∂qk

= 0 =⇒

∂L
∂ ˙qk

(6.48)

10 There is, however, one exception. A stationary point in one coordinate system might be located at
a kink in another coordinate system, so that f
is not defined there. For example, if we had instead
defined y by z = y1/4, then f (y) = y1/2, which has an undefined slope at y = 0. Basically, we’ve
stretched (or shrunk) the horizontal axis by a factor of infinity at the origin, and this is a process
that can change a zero slope into an undefined one. But let’s not worry about this.

(cid:16)

6.5 Conservation laws

233

where C is a constant, that is, independent of time. In this case, we say that qk is a
cyclic coordinate, and that ∂L/∂ ˙qk is a conserved quantity (meaning that it doesn’t
change with time). If Cartesian coordinates are used, then ∂L/∂ ˙xk is simply the
momentum, m˙xk , because ˙xk appears only in the the kinetic energy’s m˙x2
/2 term
k
(we exclude cases where the potential depends on ˙xk ). We therefore call ∂L/∂ ˙qk
the generalized momentum corresponding to the coordinate qk . And in cases
where ∂L/∂ ˙qk does not change with time, we call it a conserved momentum.
Note that a generalized momentum need not have the units of linear momentum,
as the angular-momentum examples below show.

Example (Linear momentum): Consider a ball thrown through the air. In the
full three dimensions, the Lagrangian is

L = 1
2

m(˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2) − mgz.

(6.49)

There is no x or y dependence here, so both ∂L/∂ ˙x = m˙x and ∂L/∂ ˙y = m˙y are
constant, as we well know. The fancy way of saying this is that conservation of
px ≡ m˙x arises from spatial translation invariance in the x direction. The fact that the
Lagrangian doesn’t depend on x means that it doesn’t matter if you throw the ball in
one spot, or in another spot a mile down the road. The setup is independent of the x
value. This independence leads to conservation of px. Likewise for py.

Example (Angular and linear momentum in cylindrical coordinates):
Consider a potential that depends only on the distance to the z axis. In cylindrical
coordinates, the Lagrangian is

L = 1
2

m(˙r2 + r2 ˙θ 2 + ˙z2) − V (r).

(6.50)

There is no z dependence here, so ∂L/∂ ˙z = m˙z is constant. Also, there is no θ
dependence, so ∂L/∂ ˙θ = mr2 ˙θ is constant. Since r ˙θ is the velocity in the tangential
direction around the z axis, we see that our conserved quantity, mr(r ˙θ), is the angular
momentum (discussed in Chapters 7–9) around the z axis. In the same manner as in
the preceding example, conservation of angular momentum around the z axis arises
from rotation invariance around the z axis.

In spherical coor-
Example (Angular momentum in spherical coordinates):
dinates, consider a potential that depends only on r and θ. Our convention for spherical
coordinates is that θ is the angle down from the north pole, and φ is the angle around
the equator. The Lagrangian is

L = 1
2

m(˙r2 + r2 ˙θ 2 + r2 sin2θ ˙φ2) − V (r, θ).

(6.51)

234

The Lagrangian method

There is no φ dependence here, so ∂L/∂ ˙φ = mr2 sin2θ ˙φ is constant. Since r sin θ is
the distance from the z axis, and since r sin θ ˙φ is the speed in the tangential direction
around the z axis, we see that our conserved quantity, m(r sin θ)(r sin θ ˙φ), is the
angular momentum around the z axis.

6.5.2 Energy conservation

We will now derive another conservation law, namely conservation of energy.
The conservation of momentum or angular momentum above arose when the
Lagrangian was independent of x, y, z, θ, or φ. Conservation of energy arises
when the Lagrangian is independent of time. This conservation law is different
from those in the above momenta examples, because t is not a coordinate that
the stationary-action principle can be applied to. You can imagine varying the
coordinates x, θ, etc., which are functions of t. But it makes no sense to vary t.
Therefore, we’re going to have to prove this conservation law in a different way.
Consider the quantity

E ≡

(cid:9)

N(cid:19)

i=1

∂L
∂ ˙qi

(cid:10)

˙qi

− L.

(6.52)

E turns out (usually) to be the energy. We’ll show this below. The motivation
for this expression for E comes from the theory of Legendre transforms, but we
won’t get into that here. We’ll just accept the definition in Eq. (6.52) and prove
a very useful fact about it.

Claim 6.3 If L has no explicit time dependence (that is, if ∂L/∂t = 0), then
E is conserved (that is, dE/dt = 0), assuming that the motion obeys the E–L
equations (which it does).

Note that there is one partial derivative and one total derivative in this statement.

Proof: L is a function of the qi, the ˙qi, and possibly t. Making copious use of
the chain rule, we have

(6.53)

There are five terms here. The second cancels with the fourth. And the first
(after using the E–L equation, Eq. (6.3), to rewrite it) cancels with the third. We

6.5 Conservation laws

235

therefore arrive at the simple result,

dE
dt

= −

∂L
∂t

.

(6.54)

In the event that ∂L/∂t = 0 (that is, there are no t’s sitting on the paper
when you write down L), which is usually the case in the situations we con-
sider (because we generally won’t deal with potentials that depend on time), we
have dE/dt = 0.

Not too many things are constant with respect to time, and the quantity E has
units of energy, so it’s a good bet that it’s the energy. Let’s show this in Cartesian
coordinates (however, see the remark below). The Lagrangian is

so Eq. (6.52) gives

L = 1
2

E = 1
2

m(˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2) − V (x, y, z),

(6.55)

m(˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2) + V (x, y, z),

(6.56)

which is the total energy. The effect of the operations in Eq. (6.52) in most cases
is just to switch the sign in front of the potential.

Of course, taking the kinetic energy T and subtracting the potential energy V
to obtain L, and then using Eq. (6.52) to produce E = T + V , seems like a rather
convoluted way of arriving at T + V . But the point of all this is that we used the
E–L equations to prove that E is conserved. Although we know very well from
the F = ma methods in Chapter 5 that the sum T + V is conserved, it’s not fair to
assume that it is conserved in our new Lagrangian formalism. We have to show
that this follows from the E–L equations.

As with the translation and rotation invariance we observed in the examples
in Section 6.5.1, we see that energy conservation arises from time translation
invariance. If the Lagrangian has no explicit t dependence, then the setup looks
the same today as it did yesterday. This fact leads to conservation of energy.

Remark: The quantity E in Eq. (6.52) gives the energy of the system only if the entire system
is represented by the Lagrangian. That is, the Lagrangian must represent a closed system with
no external forces. If the system is not closed, then Claim 6.3 (or more generally, Eq. (6.54)) is
still perfectly valid for the E defined in Eq. (6.52), but this E may simply not be the energy of
the system. Problem 6.8 is a good example of such a situation.

Another example is the following. Imagine a long rod in the horizontal x-y plane. The rod
points in the x direction, and a bead is free to slide frictionlessly along it. At t = 0, an external
machine is arranged to accelerate the rod in the negative y direction (that is, transverse to itself)
with acceleration −g. So ˙y = −gt. There is no internal potential energy in this system, so the

236

The Lagrangian method

Lagrangian is just the kinetic energy, L = m˙x2/2 + m(gt)2/2. Equation (6.52) therefore gives
E = m˙x2/2 − m(gt)2/2, which isn’t the energy. But Eq. (6.54) is still true, because

dE
dt

= −

∂L
∂t

⇐⇒ m˙x¨x − mg2t = −mg2t ⇐⇒ ¨x = 0,

(6.57)

which is correct. However, this setup is exactly the same as projectile motion in the x-y plane,
where y is now the vertical axis, provided that we eliminate the rod and consider gravity
instead of the machine to be causing the acceleration in the y direction. But if we are thinking in
terms of gravity, then the normal thing to do is to say that the particle moves under the influence
of the potential V (y) = mgy. The Lagrangian for this closed system (bead plus earth) is
L = m(˙x2 + ˙y2)/2 − mgy, and so Eq. (6.52) gives E = m(˙x2 + ˙y2)/2 + mgy, which is indeed
the energy of the particle. But having said all this, most of the systems we’ll deal with are
closed, so you can usually ignore this remark and assume that the E in Eq. (6.52) gives the
energy. ♣

6.6 Noether’s theorem

We now present one of the most beautiful and useful theorems in physics. It deals
with two fundamental concepts, namely symmetries and conserved quantities.
The theorem (due to Emmy Noether) may be stated as follows.

Theorem 6.4 (Noether’s theorem) For each symmetry of the Lagrangian,
there is a conserved quantity.

By “symmetry,” we mean that if the coordinates are changed by some small
quantities, then the Lagrangian has no first-order change in these quantities. By
“conserved quantity,” we mean a quantity that does not change with time. The
result in Section 6.5.1 for cyclic coordinates is a special case of this theorem.

Proof: Let the Lagrangian be invariant, to first order in the small number (cid:9),
under the change of coordinates,

qi −→ qi + (cid:9)Ki(q).

(6.58)

Each Ki(q) may be a function of all the qi, which we collectively denote by the
shorthand, q.
Remark: As an example of what these Ki’s might look like, consider the Lagrangian, L =
(m/2)(5˙x2 − 2˙x˙y + 2˙y2) + C(2x − y). We’ve just pulled this out of a hat, although it happens to
be the type of L that arises in Atwood’s machine problems; see Problem 6.9 and Exercise 6.40.
This L is invariant under the transformation x → x + (cid:9) and y → y + 2(cid:9), because the derivative
terms are unaffected, and the difference 2x − y is unchanged. (It’s actually invariant to all
orders in (cid:9), and not just first order. But this isn’t necessary for the theorem to hold.) Therefore,
Kx = 1 and Ky = 2, which happen to be independent of the coordinates. In the problems we’ll
be doing, the Ki’s can generally be determined by simply looking at the potential term.

Of course, someone else might come along with Kx = 3 and Ky = 6, which is also a
symmetry. And indeed, any factor can be taken out of (cid:9) and put into the Ki’s without changing
the quantity (cid:9)Ki(q) in Eq. (6.58). Any such modification will just bring an overall constant
factor (and hence not change the property of being conserved) into the conserved quantity in
Eq. (6.61) below. It is therefore irrelevant. ♣

The fact that the Lagrangian does not change at first order in (cid:9) means that

does not change with time. It is given the generic name of conserved momentum.
But it need not have the units of linear momentum.

As Noether most keenly observed
(And for which much acclaim is deserved),
It’s easy to see
That for each symmetry,
A quantity must be conserved.

Example 1: Consider the Lagrangian in the above remark, L = (m/2)(5˙x2 −2˙x˙y +
2˙y2) + C(2x − y). We saw that Kx = 1 and Ky = 2. The conserved momentum is
therefore

P(x, y, ˙x, ˙y) =

∂L
∂ ˙x

Kx +

∂L
∂ ˙y

Ky = m(5˙x − ˙y)(1) + m(−˙x + 2˙y)(2)

= m(3˙x + 3˙y).

(6.62)

The overall factor of 3m isn’t important.

Example 2: Consider a thrown ball. We have L = (m/2)(˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2)−mgz. This
is invariant under translations in x, that is, x → x + (cid:9); and also under translations in
y, that is, y → y + (cid:9). (Both x and y are cyclic coordinates.) We need invariance only
to first order in (cid:9) for Noether’s theorem to hold, but this L is invariant to all orders.

238

The Lagrangian method

We therefore have two symmetries in our Lagrangian. The first has Kx = 1, Ky = 0,
and Kz = 0. The second has Kx = 0, Ky = 1, and Kz = 0. Of course, the nonzero
Ki’s here can be chosen to be any constants, but we may as well pick them to be 1.
The two conserved momenta are

P1(x, y, z, ˙x, ˙y, ˙z) =

P2(x, y, z, ˙x, ˙y, ˙z) =

(6.63)

These are simply the x and y components of the linear momentum, as we saw in
the first example in Section 6.5.1. Note that any combination of these momenta, say
3P1 + 8P2, is also conserved. (In other words, x → x + 3(cid:9), y → y + 8(cid:9), z → z is
a symmetry of the Lagrangian.) But the above P1 and P2 are the simplest momenta
to choose as a “basis” for the infinite number of conserved momenta (which is how
many you have, if there are two or more independent continuous symmetries).

Example 3: Consider a mass on a spring, with relaxed length zero, in the x-y plane.
The Lagrangian, L = (m/2)(˙x2 + ˙y2) − (k/2)(x2 + y2), is invariant under the change
of coordinates, x → x + (cid:9)y and y → y − (cid:9)x, to first order in (cid:9) (as you can check).
So we have Kx = y and Ky = −x. The conserved momentum is therefore

P(x, y, ˙x, ˙y) =

∂L
∂ ˙x

Kx +

∂L
∂ ˙y

Ky = m(˙xy − ˙yx).

(6.64)

This is the (negative of the) z component of the angular momentum. The angular
momentum is conserved here because the potential, V (x, y) ∝ x2 + y2 = r2, depends
only on the distance from the origin. We’ll discuss such potentials in Chapter 7.

In contrast with the first two examples above, the x → x + (cid:9)y, y → y − (cid:9)x transfor-
mation isn’t so obvious here. How did we get this? Well, unfortunately there doesn’t
seem to be any fail-safe method of determining the Ki’s in general, so sometimes you
just have to guess around. But in many problems, the Ki’s are simple constants which
are easy to see.

Remarks:

1. As we saw above, in some cases the Ki’s are functions of the coordinates, and in some

cases they are not.

2. The cyclic-coordinate result in Eq. (6.48) is a special case of Noether’s theorem, for the
following reason. If L doesn’t depend on a certain coordinate qk , then qk −→ qk + (cid:9) is
certainly a symmetry. Hence Kk = 1 (with all the other Ki’s equal to zero), and Eq. (6.60)
reduces to Eq. (6.48).

3. We use the word “symmetry” to describe the situation where the transformation in
Eq. (6.58) produces no first-order change in the Lagrangian. This is an appropriate choice
of word, because the Lagrangian describes the system, and if the system essentially
doesn’t change when the coordinates are changed, then we say that the system is sym-
metric. For example, if we have a setup that doesn’t depend on θ , then we say that the
setup is symmetric under rotations. Rotate the system however you want, and it looks

6.7 Small oscillations

239

the same. The two most common applications of Noether’s theorem are the conservation
of angular momentum, which arises from symmetry under rotations; and conservation of
linear momentum, which arises from symmetry under translations.

4. In simple systems, as in Example 2 above, it is clear why the resulting P is conserved. But
in more complicated systems, as in Example 1 above, the resulting P might not have an
obvious interpretation. But at least you know that it is conserved, and this will invariably
help in understanding a setup.

5. Although conserved quantities are extremely useful in studying a physical situation, it
should be stressed that there is no more information contained in them than there is in
the E–L equations. Conserved quantities are simply the result of integrating the E–L
equations. For example, if you write down the E–L equations for Example 1 above, and
then add the “x” equation (which is 5m¨x − m¨y = 2C) to twice the “y” equation (which
is −m¨x + 2m¨y = −C), then you arrive at 3m(¨x + ¨y) = 0. In other words, 3m(˙x + ˙y) is
constant, as we found from Noether’s theorem.

Of course, you might have to do some guesswork to find the proper combination of
the E–L equations that gives a zero on the right-hand side. But you’d have to do some
guesswork anyway, to find the symmetry for Noether’s theorem. At any rate, a conserved
quantity is useful because it is an integrated form of the E–L equations. It puts you one
step closer to solving the problem, compared with where you would be if you started with
the second-order E–L equations.

6. Does every system have a conserved momentum? Certainly not. The one-dimensional
problem of a falling ball (m¨z = −mg) doesn’t have one. And if you write down an
arbitrary potential in 3-D, odds are that there won’t be one. In a sense, things have to
contrive nicely for there to be a conserved momentum. In some problems, you can just
look at the physical system and see what the symmetry is, but in others (for example, in
the Atwood’s-machine problems for this chapter), the symmetry is not at all obvious.
7. By “conserved quantity,” we mean a quantity that depends on (at most) the coordinates
and their first derivatives (that is, not on their second derivatives). If we don’t make
this restriction, then it is trivial to construct quantities that are independent of time. For
example, in Example 1 above, the “x” E–L equation (which is 5m¨x − m¨y = 2C) tells
us that 5m¨x − m¨y has its time derivative equal to zero. Note that an equivalent way of
excluding these trivial cases is to say that the value of a conserved quantity depends on
the initial conditions (that is, the velocities and positions). The quantity 5m¨x − m¨y doesn’t
satisfy this criterion, because its value is always constrained to be 2C. ♣

6.7 Small oscillations

In many physical systems, a particle undergoes small oscillations around an
equilibrium point. In Section 5.2, we showed that the frequency of these small
oscillations is

(cid:1)

ω =

V (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)
m

,

(6.65)

where V (x) is the potential energy, and x0 is the equilibrium point. However, this
result holds only for one-dimensional motion (we’ll see below why this is true).
In more complicated systems, such as the one described below, it is necessary
to use another procedure to obtain the frequency ω. This procedure is a fail-safe
one, applicable in all situations. It is, however, a bit more involved than simply
writing down Eq. (6.65). So in one-dimensional problems, Eq. (6.65) is still what
you want to use. We’ll demonstrate our fail-safe method through the following
problem.

240

The Lagrangian method

M

Fig. 6.5

Problem: A mass m is free to slide on a frictionless table and is connected, via
a string that passes through a hole in the table, to a mass M that hangs below (see
Fig. 6.5). Assume that M moves in a vertical line only, and assume that the string
always remains taut.

(a) Find the equations of motion for the variables r and θ shown in the figure.
(b) Under what condition does m undergo circular motion?
(c) What is the frequency of small oscillations (in the variable r) about this circular

motion?

Solution:

(a) Let the string have length (cid:2) (this length won’t matter). Then the Lagrangian
(we’ll call it “L” here, to save “L” for the angular momentum, which arises
below) is

L = 1
2

M ˙r2 + 1
2

m(˙r2 + r2 ˙θ 2) + Mg((cid:2) − r).

(6.66)

For the purposes of the potential energy, we’ve taken the table to be at height
zero, but any other value could be chosen. The E–L equations of motion
obtained from varying θ and r are

(mr2 ˙θ) = 0,

d
dt
(M + m)¨r = mr ˙θ 2 − Mg.

(6.67)

The first equation says that angular momentum is conserved. The second
equation says that the Mg gravitational force accounts for the acceleration of
the two masses along the direction of the string, plus the centripetal acceleration
of m.

(b) The first of Eqs. (6.67) says that mr2 ˙θ = L, where L is some constant (the
angular momentum) which depends on the initial conditions. Plugging ˙θ =
L/mr2 into the second of Eqs. (6.67) gives

(M + m)¨r = L2
mr3

− Mg.

(6.68)

Circular motion occurs when ˙r = ¨r = 0. Therefore, the radius of the circular
orbit is given by

r3
0

= L2
Mmg

.

Since L = mr2 ˙θ, Eq. (6.69) is equivalent to

˙θ 2 = Mg,

mr0

(6.69)

(6.70)

6.7 Small oscillations

241

which can also be obtained by letting ¨r = 0 in the second of Eqs. (6.67). In
other words, the gravitational force on M exactly accounts for the centripetal
acceleration of m if the motion is circular. Given r0, Eq. (6.70) determines
what ˙θ must be in order to have circular motion, and vice versa.

(c) To find the frequency of small oscillations about the circular motion, we need
to look at what happens to r if we perturb it slightly from its equilibrium value
of r0. Our fail-safe procedure is the following.

Let r(t) ≡ r0 + δ(t), where δ(t) is very small (more precisely, δ(t) (cid:4) r0),

and expand Eq. (6.68) to first order in δ(t). Using

(6.71)

(6.72)

The terms not involving δ on the right-hand side cancel, by the definition of r0
given in Eq. (6.69). This cancellation always occurs in such a problem at this
stage, due to the definition of the equilibrium point. We are therefore left with

(cid:9)

¨δ +

3L2

(cid:10)

δ ≈ 0.

(6.73)

This is a good old simple-harmonic-oscillator equation in the variable δ.
Therefore, the frequency of small oscillations about a circle of radius r0 is

where we have used Eq. (6.69) to eliminate L in the second expression.

To sum up, the above frequency is the frequency of small oscillations in
the variable r. In other words, if you have nearly circular motion, and if you
plot r as a function of time (and ignore what θ is doing), then you will get a
nice sinusoidal graph whose frequency is given by Eq. (6.74). Note that this
frequency need not have anything to do with the other relevant frequency in this
g/r0,
problem, namely the frequency of the circular motion, which is
from Eq. (6.70).

The frequency of small oscillations is equal to the frequency of circular motion if

M = 2m, which, once again, isn’t obvious. This condition is independent of r0. ♣

242

The Lagrangian method

The above procedure for finding the frequency of small oscillations can be
summed up in three steps: (1) find the equations of motion; (2) find the equilib-
rium point; and (3) let x(t) ≡ x0 + δ(t), where x0 is the equilibrium point of the
relevant variable, and expand one of the equations of motion (or a combination
of them) to first order in δ, to obtain a simple-harmonic-oscillator equation for δ.
If the equilibrium point happens to be at x = 0 (which is often the case), then
everything is greatly simplified. There is no need to introduce δ, and the expan-
sion in the third step above simply entails ignoring powers of x that are higher
than first order.

Remark:
If you just use the potential energy for the above problem (which is Mgr, up to an
additive constant) in Eq. (6.65), then you will obtain a frequency of zero, which is incorrect.
You can use Eq. (6.65) to find the frequency, if you instead use the “effective potential” for
this problem, namely L2/(2mr2) + Mgr, and if you use the total mass, M + m, as the mass
in Eq. (6.65), as you can check. The reason why this works will become clear in Chapter 7
when we introduce the effective potential. In many problems, however, it isn’t obvious what
the appropriate modified potential is that should be used, or what mass goes in Eq. (6.65). So
it’s generally much safer to take a deep breath and go through an expansion similar to the one
in part (c) of the example above. ♣

The one-dimensional result in Eq. (6.65) is, of course, a special case of our
above expansion procedure. We can repeat the derivation of Section 5.2 in the
present language. In one dimension, the E–L equation of motion is m¨x = −V (cid:16)(x).
Let x0 be the equilibrium point, so V (cid:16)(x0) = 0. And let x(t) ≡ x0 + δ(t).
Expanding m¨x = −V (cid:16)(x) to first order in δ, we have m ¨δ = −V (cid:16)(x0) − V (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)δ,
plus higher-order terms. Since V (cid:16)(x0) = 0, we have m ¨δ ≈ −V (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)δ, as
desired.

6.8 Other applications
The formalism developed in Section 6.2 works for any function L(x, ˙x, t). If our
goal is to find the stationary points of S ≡
L, then Eq. (6.15) holds, no matter
what L is. There is no need for L to be equal to T − V , or indeed, to have anything
to do with physics. And t need not have anything to do with time. All that is
required is that the quantity x depend on the parameter t, and that L depend only
on x, ˙x, and t (and not, for example, on ¨x; see Exercise 6.34). The formalism is
very general and powerful, as the following example demonstrates.

(cid:17)

Example (Minimal surface of revolution): A surface of revolution has two
given parallel rings as its boundary; see Fig. 6.6. What should the shape of the surface
be so that it has the minimum possible area? We will present three solutions. A fourth
is left for Problem 6.22.

First solution: Let the surface be generated by rotating the curve y = y(x) around
the x axis. The boundary conditions are y(a1) = c1 and y(a2) = c2; see Fig. 6.7.

exactly the same situation as in Section 6.2, except that x is now the parameter (instead
1 + y(cid:16)2.
of t), and y is now the function (instead of x). Our “Lagrangian” is thus L ∝ y

in Eq. (6.86) which gives (with f (y) = y here)

1 + y

(cid:16)2 = By2.

that the solution is

y(x) = 1

c2 = 1

cosh b(a1 + d),

b

z2 − 1 is cosh

(6.80)

and

In the symmetrical case where c1 = c2, we know that the minimum occurs in the
middle, so we may choose d = 0 and a1 = −a2.

Solutions for b and d exist only for certain ranges of the a’s and c’s. Basically, if
a2 − a1 is too large, then there is no solution. In this case, the minimal “surface” turns
out to be the two given circles, attached by a line (which isn’t a nice two-dimensional
surface). If you perform an experiment with soap bubbles (which want to minimize
their area), and if you pull the rings too far apart, then the surface will break and
disappear as it tries to form the two circles. Problem 6.23 deals with this issue.

Second solution: Consider the curve that we rotate around the x axis to be
described now by the function x(y). That is, let x be a function of y. The area is
then given by

A =

third solutions here, it is highly advantageous to make use of conserved quantities
whenever you can.

Let us now prove the following lemma, which we invoked in the first solution
above. This lemma is very useful, because it is common to encounter problems
1 + y(cid:16)2, and takes
where the quantity to be extremized depends on the arclength,
1 + y(cid:16)2 dx. We will give two proofs. The first proof uses the
the form of
Euler–Lagrange equation. The calculation gets a bit messy, so it’s a good idea to
work through it once and for all and then just invoke the result whenever needed.
This derivation isn’t something you’d want to repeat too often. The second proof
makes use of a conserved quantity. And in contrast with the first proof, this
method is exceedingly clean and simple. It actually is something you’d want to
repeat quite often. But we’ll still do it once and for all.

Lemma 6.5 Let f (y) be a given function of y. Then the function y(x) that

(6.89)

We have completed the first step of the proof, namely producing the Euler–
Lagrange differential equation. We must now integrate it. Equation (6.89)
happens to be integrable for arbitrary functions f (y). If we multiply through
by y(cid:16) and rearrange, we obtain

y(cid:16)y(cid:16)(cid:16)
1 + y(cid:16)2

(6.90)

Taking the dx integral of both sides gives (1/2) ln(1 + y(cid:16)2) = ln(f ) + C, where
C is a constant of integration. Exponentiation then gives (with B ≡ e2C )

1 + y

(cid:16)2 = Bf (y)2,

(6.91)

as we wanted to show. In an actual problem, we would solve this equation for y(cid:16),
and then separate variables and integrate. But we would need to be given a specific
function f (y) to be able to do this.

11 The constant B and also one other constant of integration (arising when Eq. (6.86) is integrated to
obtain y) are determined by the boundary conditions on y(x); see, for example, Eq. (6.80). This
situation, where the two constants are determined by the values of the function at two points, is
slightly different from the situation in the physics problems we’ve done where the two constants
are determined by the value (that is, the initial position) and the slope (that is, the speed) at just
one point. But either way, two given facts must be used.

246

The Lagrangian method

1 + y(cid:16)2, is independent of x.
Second proof: Our “Lagrangian,” L = f (y)

For practice, you can also prove this lemma by considering x to be a function of

then have a greater appreciation for the Lagrangian method.)

The bottom end of the lower stick is hinged at the ground. They are held
such that the lower stick is vertical, and the upper one is tilted at a

6.4. Two masses, one swinging ***

Two equal masses m, connected by a massless string, hang over two
pulleys (of negligible size), as shown in Fig. 6.11. The left one moves
in a vertical line, but the right one is free to swing back and forth in the
plane of the masses and pulleys. Find the equations of motion for r and

Assume that the left mass starts at rest, and the right mass undergoes
small oscillations with angular amplitude (cid:9) (with (cid:9) (cid:4) 1). What is the

mass? In which direction does it move?

6.5. Inverted pendulum ****

A pendulum consists of a mass m at the end of a massless stick of length
(cid:2). The other end of the stick is made to oscillate vertically with a position
given by y(t) = A cos(ωt), where A (cid:4) (cid:2). See Fig. 6.12. It turns out
that if ω is large enough, and if the pendulum is initially nearly upside-
down, then surprisingly it will not fall over as time goes by. Instead, it
will (sort of) oscillate back and forth around the vertical position. If you
want to do the experiment yourself, see the 28th demonstration of the
entertaining collection in Ehrlich (1994).

Find the equation of motion for the angle of the pendulum (measured
relative to its upside-down position). Explain why the pendulum doesn’t
fall over, and find the frequency of the back and forth motion.

Assume that the speed of light in a given slab of material is proportional

Derive the shape of the minimal surface discussed in Section 6.8, by

tension must be constant throughout the surface (assuming that we’re
ignoring gravity, which we are).

Consider the minimal surface from Section 6.8, and look at the special
case where the two rings have the same radius r (see Fig. 6.25). Let

12 If you want to make the equivalent statement in terms of the material’s “index of refraction,”
commonly denoted by n, then you can say: As a function of the height y, the index n is given by
n(y) = y0/y, where y0 is some length that is larger than the height of the slab. This is equivalent
to the original statement because the speed of light in a material equals c/n.

A rigid T consists of a long rod glued perpendicular to another rod of
length (cid:2) that is pivoted at the origin. The T rotates around in a horizontal
plane with constant frequency ω. A mass m is free to slide along the
long rod and is connected to the intersection of the rods by a spring

6.27. Coffee cup and mass **

A coffee cup of mass M is connected to a mass m by a string. The coffee
cup hangs over a frictionless pulley of negligible size, and the mass m
is initially held with the string horizontal, as shown in Fig. 6.28. The
mass m is then released. Find the equations of motion for r (the length
of string between m and the pulley) and θ (the angle that the string to
m makes with the horizontal). Assume that m somehow doesn’t run into
the string holding the cup up.

The coffee cup will initially fall, but it turns out that it will reach a
lowest point and then rise back up. Write a program (see Section 1.4)
that numerically determines the ratio of the r at this lowest point to the r
at the start, for a given value of m/M . (To check your program, a value
of m/M = 1/10 yields a ratio of about 0.208.)

end of the lower stick is hinged at the ground. They are held such that
the lower two sticks are vertical, and the upper one is tilted at a small

The standard pendulum frequency of

out that if you want to build a pendulum whose frequency is independent
of the amplitude, you should hang it from the cusp of a cycloid of a cer-
tain size, as shown in Fig. 6.30. As the string wraps partially around the
cycloid, the effect is to decrease the length of string in the air, which in
turn increases the frequency back up to a constant value. In more detail:
A cycloid is the path taken by a point on the rim of a rolling wheel.
The upside-down cycloid in Fig. 6.30 can be parametrized by (x, y) =
R(θ −sin θ, −1+cos θ), where θ = 0 corresponds to the cusp. Consider
a pendulum of length 4R hanging from the cusp, and let α be the angle

The Lagrangian method

The equations of motion obtained from varying x1 and x2 are

M ¨x1 + m(¨x1 + ¨x2) tan2θ = mg tan θ ,
m¨x2 + m(¨x1 + ¨x2) tan2θ = mg tan θ .

(6.100)

Note that the difference of these two equations immediately yields conservation of
momentum, M ¨x1 − m¨x2 = 0 =⇒ (d/dt)(M ˙x1 − m˙x2) = 0. Equations (6.100) are two
linear equations in the two unknowns, ¨x1 and ¨x2, so we can solve for ¨x1. After a little
simplification, we arrive at

¨x1 = mg sin θ cos θ
M + m sin2θ

.

(6.101)

For some limiting cases, see the remarks in the solution to Problem 3.8.

6.2. Two falling sticks

Let θ1(t) and θ2(t) be defined as in Fig. 6.38. Then the position of the bottom mass
in Cartesian coordinates is (r sin θ1, r cos θ1), and the position of the top mass is
(2r sin θ1 − r sin θ2, 2r cos θ1 + r cos θ2). So the potential energy of the system is

V (θ1, θ2) = mgr(3 cos θ1 + cos θ2).

(6.102)

The kinetic energy is somewhat more complicated. The kinetic energy of the bottom
mass is simply mr2 ˙θ 2
/2. Taking the derivative of the top mass’s position given above,
1
we find that the kinetic energy of the top mass is

(cid:7)

(2 cos θ1

˙θ1 − cos θ2

˙θ2)2 + (−2 sin θ1

˙θ1 − sin θ2

˙θ2)2

(cid:8)

.

(6.103)

We can simplify this, using the small-angle approximations. The terms involving sin θ
are fourth order in the small θ ’s, so we can neglect them. Also, we can approximate
cos θ by 1, because this entails dropping only terms of at least fourth order. So the
top mass’s kinetic energy becomes (1/2)mr2(2 ˙θ1 − ˙θ2)2. In retrospect, it would have
been easier to obtain the kinetic energies of the masses by first applying the small-angle
approximations to the positions, and then taking the derivatives to obtain the velocities.
This strategy shows that both masses move essentially horizontally (initially). You will
probably want to use this strategy when solving Exercise 6.28.

Using the small-angle approximation cos θ ≈ 1 − θ 2/2 to rewrite the potential

energy in Eq. (6.102), we have

(6.110)

(6.111)

In retrospect, this makes sense. Someone in the reference frame of the support, which
has horizontal acceleration ¨x = −Aω2 cos(ωt), may as well be living in a world
where the acceleration from gravity has a component g downward and a component
Aω2 cos(ωt) to the right. Equation (6.111) is just the F = ma equation in the tangential
direction in this accelerating world.

A small-angle approximation in Eq. (6.111) gives

where C and φ are determined by the initial conditions.

If ω happens to equal ω0, then it appears that the amplitude goes to infinity. However,
as soon as the amplitude becomes large, our small-angle approximation breaks down,
and Eqs. (6.112) and (6.113) are no longer valid.

m(˙r2 + r2 ˙θ 2) − mgr + mgr cos θ .

(6.114)

The last two terms are the (negatives of the) potentials of each mass, relative to where
they would be if the right mass were located at the right pulley. The equations of motion
obtained from varying r and θ are

2¨r = r ˙θ 2 − g(1 − cos θ ),

(6.115)

The first equation deals with the forces and accelerations along the direction of the
string. The second equation equates the torque from gravity with the change in angular
momentum of the right mass. If we do a (coarse) small-angle approximation and keep
only terms up to first order in θ, we find that at t = 0 (using the initial condition,
˙r = 0), Eqs. (6.115) become

¨r = 0,

θ = 0.

The Lagrangian method

These equations say that the left mass stays still, and the right mass behaves just like
a pendulum.

If we want to find the leading term in the initial acceleration of the left mass (that
is, the leading term in ¨r), we need to be a little less coarse in our approximation. So
let’s keep terms in Eq. (6.115) up to second order in θ . We then have at t = 0 (using
the initial condition, ˙r = 0)

2¨r = r ˙θ 2 − 1

The second equation still says that the right mass undergoes harmonic motion. We are
told that the amplitude is (cid:9), so we have

This is a small second-order effect. It is positive, so the left mass slowly begins to
climb.

6.5. Inverted pendulum

Let θ be defined as in Fig. 6.40. With y(t) = A cos(ωt), the position of the mass m is
given by

(X , Y ) = ((cid:2) sin θ , y + (cid:2) cos θ ).

(6.121)

Taking the derivative to obtain the velocity, we find that the square of the speed is
V 2 = ˙X 2 + ˙Y 2 = (cid:2)2 ˙θ 2 + ˙y2 − 2(cid:2)˙y ˙θ sin θ ,
(6.122)
which also follows from applying the law of cosines to the vertical ˙y and tangential (cid:2) ˙θ
parts of the velocity vector. The Lagrangian is therefore

L = 1

m((cid:2)2 ˙θ 2 + ˙y2 − 2(cid:2)˙y ˙θ sin θ ) − mg(y + (cid:2) cos θ ).

the acceleration from gravity is g − Aω2 cos(ωt) downward. Equation (6.125) is just
the F = ma equation in the tangential direction in this accelerating world.

Assuming θ is small, we may set sin θ ≈ θ , which gives

where ω0 ≡
g/(cid:2) and a ≡ A/(cid:2). Equation (6.126) cannot be solved exactly, but we
can still get a good idea of how θ depends on time. We can do this both numerically
and (approximately) analytically.

Figure 6.41 shows how θ depends on time for parameters with values (cid:2) = 1 m,
= 10 s−2. We produced these plots
A = 0.1 m, and g = 10 m/s2. So a = 0.1, and ω2
0
numerically using Eq. (6.126), with the initial conditions of θ (0) = 0.1 and ˙θ (0) = 0.
In the first plot, ω = 10 s−1. And in the second plot, ω = 100 s−1. The stick falls over
in first case, but it undergoes oscillatory motion in the second case. Apparently, if ω is
large enough the stick won’t fall over.

Let’s now explain this phenomenon analytically. At first glance, it’s rather surprising
that the stick stays up. It seems like the average (over a few periods of the ω oscillations)
of the tangential acceleration in Eq. (6.126), namely −θ (aω2 cos(ωt) − ω2
), equals
0
0, because the cos(ωt) term averages to zero (or so it appears).
the positive quantity θω2
So you might think that there is a net force making θ increase, causing the stick to
fall over.

The error in this reasoning is that the average of the −aω2θ cos(ωt) term is not zero,
because θ undergoes tiny oscillations with frequency ω, as seen in the second plot in
= 10 s−2, and ω = 1000 s−1 (we’ll
Fig. 6.42. Both of these plots have a = 0.005, ω2
0
work with small a and large ω from now on; more on this below). The second plot is
a zoomed-in version of the first one near t = 0. The important point here is that the
tiny oscillations in θ shown in the second plot are correlated with cos(ωt). It turns out
that the θ value at the t where cos(ωt) = 1 is larger than the θ value at the t where
cos(ωt) = −1. So there is a net negative contribution to the −aω2θ cos(ωt) part of
the acceleration. And it may indeed be large enough to keep the pendulum up, as we
will now show.

To get a handle on the −aω2θ cos(ωt) term, let’s work in the approximation where
ω is large and a ≡ A/(cid:2) is small. More precisely, we will assume a (cid:4) 1 and aω2 (cid:6) ω2
0,
for reasons we will explain below. Look at one of the little oscillations in the second
plot in Fig. 6.42. These oscillations have frequency ω, because they are due to the

support moving up and down. When the support moves up, θ increases; and when the
support moves down, θ decreases. Since the average position of the pendulum doesn’t
change much over one of these small periods, we can look for an approximate solution
to Eq. (6.126) of the form

θ (t) ≈ C + b cos(ωt),

(6.127)

where b (cid:4) C. C will change over time, but on the scale of 1/ω it is essentially
constant, if a ≡ A/(cid:2) is small enough. Plugging this guess for θ into Eq. (6.126), and
using a (cid:4) 1 and aω2 (cid:6) ω2
0, we find −bω2 cos(ωt) + Caω2 cos(ωt) = 0, to leading
order.13 So we must have b = aC. Our approximate solution for θ is therefore

But if we take two derivatives of Eq. (6.127), we see that ¨θ simply equals ¨C. Equating
this value of ¨θ with the one in Eq. (6.129) gives

¨C(t) + (cid:18)2C(t) ≈ 0.

(6.131)

This equation describes nice simple-harmonic motion. Therefore, C oscillates sinu-
soidally with the frequency (cid:18) given in Eq. (6.130). This is the overall back and forth

can legally ignore the ¨C term when Eq. (6.127) is substituted into Eq. (6.126). This is true because
we will find below in Eq. (6.129) that our assumptions lead to ¨C being roughly proportional to
Ca2ω2. Since the other terms in Eq. (6.126) are proportional to Caω2, we need a (cid:4) 1 in order
for the ¨C term to be negligible. In short, a (cid:4) 1 is the condition under which C varies slowly on
the time scale of 1/ω.

In order to obtain the smallest value of T that can make this sum negative, we
want only the n = 1 term to exist. We then have ξ(t) = c1 sin(πt/T ), and
Eq. (6.134) reduces to Eq. (6.133), as it should.

As mentioned in Remark 4 in Section 6.2, it is always possible to make (cid:16)S
positive by picking a ξ(t) function that is small but wiggles very fast. Therefore,
we see that for a harmonic oscillator, if T > τ/2, then the stationary value of
S is a saddle point (some ξ ’s make (cid:16)S positive, and some make it negative),
but if T < τ/2, then the stationary value of S is a minimum (all ξ ’s make (cid:16)S
positive). In the latter case, the point is that T is small enough so that there is
no way for ξ to get large, without making ˙ξ large also. ♣

6.7. Normal force from a plane

First solution: The most convenient coordinates in this problem are w and z, where
w is the distance upward along the plane, and z is the distance perpendicularly away
from it. The Lagrangian is then

Second solution: We can also solve this problem by using the horizontal and vertical
coordinates, x and y. We’ll choose (x, y) = (0, 0) to be at the top of the plane; see
Fig. 6.43. The (very steep) constraining potential is V (z), where z ≡ x sin θ + y cos θ
is the distance from the mass to the plane (as you can verify). The Lagrangian is then

condition, along with the two E–L equations, allows us to solve for the three unknowns,
¨x, ¨y, and V (cid:16)(0). Using ¨x = −¨y cot θ in Eq. (6.139), we find

¨x = g cos θ sin θ ,

¨y = −g sin2θ , Fc ≡ −V

(cid:16)(0) = mg cos θ .

(6.140)

The first two results here are simply the horizontal and vertical components of the
acceleration along the plane, which is g sin θ .

T , which comes from the radial and tangential motions:

energy of the bead, due to the minus sign in the second term.

E = 1

mr2ω2.

(6.142)

The point here is that in order to keep the stick rotating at a constant angular speed,
there must be an external force acting on it. This force in turn causes work to be done
on the bead, thereby increasing its kinetic energy. The kinetic energy T is therefore not
conserved. From Eqs. (6.141) and (6.142), we see that E = T − mr2ω2 is the quantity
that is constant in time. See Exercise 6.39 for some F = ma ways to show that the
quantity E in Eq. (6.142) is conserved.

This is invariant under the transformation x → x + 2(cid:9) and y → y + (cid:9). Hence, we can

Ky = m(7˙x + 3˙y)(2) + m(3˙x + 4˙y)(1) = m(17˙x + 10˙y).

This P is constant. In particular, if the system starts at rest, then ˙x always equals
−(10/17)˙y.

Second solution:

The Euler–Lagrange equations are, from Eq. (6.143),

7m¨x + 3m¨y = −mg,

Let the radius to M make an angle θ with the vertical (see Fig. 6.44). Then the coor-
dinates of M relative to the center of the hoop are R(sin θ , − cos θ ). The height of
m, relative to its position when M is at the bottom of the hoop, is y = −Rθ . The

Equilibrium occurs when ˙θ = ¨θ = 0. From Eq. (6.150), we see that this happens at

If M is only slightly greater than m, then θ0 ≈ π/2, and ω ≈ 0. This also makes
sense, because if θ ≈ π/2, then the restoring force g(m − M sin θ ) doesn’t change
much as θ changes (the derivative of sin θ is zero at θ = π/2), so it’s as if we have a
pendulum in a very weak gravitational field.

We can actually derive the frequency in Eq. (6.152) without doing any calcula-
tions. Look at M at the equilibrium position. The tangential forces on it cancel, and
the radially inward force from the hoop must be Mg cos θ0 to balance the radial out-
ward component of the gravitational force. Therefore, for all the mass M knows, it
is sitting at the bottom of a hoop of radius R in a world where gravity has strength
g(cid:16) = g cos θ0. The general formula for the frequency of a pendulum (as you can
F (cid:16)/M (cid:16)R, where F (cid:16) is the gravitational force (which is Mg(cid:16)
quickly show) is ω =
here), and M (cid:16) is the total mass being accelerated (which is M + m here). This gives the
ω in Eq. (6.152). (This reasoning is a little subtle; food for thought.) ♣

6.11. Bead on a rotating hoop

Breaking the velocity up into the component along the hoop plus the component
perpendicular to the hoop, we find

L = 1
2

m(ω2R2 sin2θ + R2 ˙θ 2) + mgR cos θ .

(6.153)

The equation of motion is then

R ¨θ = sin θ (ω2R cos θ − g).
(6.154)
The F = ma interpretation of this is that the component of gravity pulling downward
along the hoop accounts for the acceleration along the hoop plus the component of the
centripetal acceleration along the hoop.

Equilibrium occurs when ˙θ = ¨θ = 0. The right-hand side of Eq. (6.154) equals zero
when either sin θ = 0 (that is, θ = 0 or θ = π) or cos θ = g/(ω2R). Since cos θ must
be less than or equal to 1, this second condition is possible only if ω2 ≥ g/R. So we
have two cases:

• If ω2 < g/R, then θ = 0 and θ = π are the only equilibrium points.

The θ = π case is unstable. This is fairly intuitive, but it can also be seen
mathematically by letting θ ≡ π + δ, where δ is small. Equation (6.154) then
becomes

¨δ − δ(ω2 + g/R) = 0.
(6.155)
The coefficient of δ is negative, so δ undergoes exponential instead of oscillatory
motion.

The θ = 0 case turns out to be stable. For small θ , Eq. (6.154) becomes

¨θ + θ (g/R − ω2) = 0.
(6.156)
The coefficient of θ is positive, so we have sinusoidal solutions. The frequency
of small oscillations is

g/R − ω2. This goes to zero as ω →

g/R.

√

(cid:4)

• If ω2 ≥ g/R, then θ = 0, θ = π, and cos θ0 ≡ g/(ω2R) are all equilibrium
points. The θ = π case is again unstable, by looking at Eq. (6.155). And the

6.11 Solutions

265

θ = 0 case is also unstable, because the coefficient of θ in Eq. (6.156) is now
negative (or zero, if ω2 = g/R).

Therefore, cos θ0 ≡ g/(ω2R) is the only stable equilibrium. To find the fre-
quency of small oscillations, let θ ≡ θ0 + δ in Eq. (6.154), and expand to first
order in δ. Using cos θ0 ≡ g/(ω2R), we find

The frequency of small oscillations is therefore ω sin θ0 =

The frequency ω =

Remark: This frequency of small oscillations goes to zero as ω →
g/R.
And it approximately equals ω as ω → ∞. This second limit can be viewed
in the following way. For very large ω, gravity isn’t important, and the bead
feels a centripetal force (the normal force from the hoop) essentially equal to
mω2R as it moves near θ = π/2. So for all the bead knows, it is a pendulum of
length R in a world where “gravity” pulls sideways with a force mω2R ≡ mg(cid:16)
(outward, so that it is approximately canceled by the inward-pointing normal
force, just as the downward gravitational force is approximately canceled by the
upward tension in a regular pendulum). The frequency of such a pendulum is

6.12. Another bead on a rotating hoop

With the angles ωt and θ defined as in Fig. 6.45, the Cartesian coordinates for the bead
are

(x, y) =

(cid:5)

(cid:6)
R cos ωt + r cos(ωt + θ), R sin ωt + r sin(ωt + θ )

.

(6.158)

The velocity is then

(x, y) =

(cid:5)

−ωR sin ωt − r(ω + ˙θ) sin(ωt + θ ),
(cid:6)
ωR cos ωt + r(ω + ˙θ ) cos(ωt + θ )

.

(6.159)

The square of the speed is therefore
v2 = R2ω2 + r2(ω + ˙θ)2
+ 2Rrω(ω + ˙θ)

(cid:5)

(cid:6)
sin ωt sin(ωt + θ) + cos ωt cos(ωt + θ )

= R2ω2 + r2(ω + ˙θ)2 + 2Rrω(ω + ˙θ) cos θ .

(6.160)

This speed can also be obtained by using the law of cosines to add the velocity
of the center of the hoop to the velocity of the bead with respect to the center (as
you can show).

There is no potential energy, so the Lagrangian is simply L = mv2/2. The equation

of motion is then, as you can show,

r ¨θ + Rω2 sin θ = 0.
(6.161)
Equilibrium occurs when ˙θ = ¨θ = 0, so Eq. (6.161) tells us that the equilibrium
is located at θ = 0, which makes intuitive sense. (Another solution is θ = π, but
that’s an unstable equilibrium.) A small-angle approximation in Eq. (6.161) gives
¨θ + (R/r)ω2θ = 0, so the frequency of small oscillations is (cid:18) = ω

R/r.

√

If R (cid:4) r, then (cid:18) ≈ 0. This makes sense, because the frictionless hoop
Remarks:
is essentially not moving. If R = r, then (cid:18) = ω. If R (cid:6) r, then (cid:18) is very large.
√
In this case, we can double-check the (cid:18) = ω
R/r result in the following way. In

266

The Lagrangian method

the accelerating frame of the hoop, the bead feels a centrifugal force (discussed in
Chapter 10) of m(R + r)ω2. For all the bead knows, it is in a gravitational field with
strength g(cid:16) ≡ (R+r)ω2. So the bead (which acts like a pendulum of length r), oscillates
with a frequency equal to

Note that if we try to use this “effective gravity” argument as a double check for smaller
values of R, we get the wrong answer. For example, if R = r, we obtain an oscillation

the centrifugal force fans out near the equilibrium point, while our “effective gravity”
argument assumes that the field lines are parallel (and so it gives a frequency that is

6.13. Mass on a wheel

Let the angle θ be defined as in Fig. 6.46, with the convention that θ is positive if M is
to the right of m. Then the position of m in Cartesian coordinates, relative to the point
where m would be in contact with the ground, is

(x, y)m = R(θ − sin θ , 1 − cos θ ).

(6.163)

We have used the nonslipping condition to say that the present contact point is a
distance Rθ to the right of where m would be in contact with the ground. Differentiating
Eq. (6.163), we find that the square of m’s speed is v2
m

= 2R2 ˙θ 2(1 − cos θ ).
The position of M is (x, y)M = R(θ, 1), so the square of its speed is v2
M

= R2 ˙θ 2.

The Lagrangian is therefore

L = 1
2

MR2 ˙θ 2 + mR2 ˙θ 2(1 − cos θ ) + mgR cos θ ,

(6.164)

where we have measured both potential energies relative to the height of M . The
equation of motion is

MR ¨θ + 2mR ¨θ (1 − cos θ ) + mR ˙θ 2 sin θ + mg sin θ = 0.

(6.165)

In the case of small oscillations, we can use cos θ ≈ 1−θ 2/2 and sin θ ≈ θ . The second
and third terms in Eq. (6.165) are then third order in θ and can be neglected (basically,
the middle term in Eq. (6.164), which is the kinetic energy of m, is negligible), so we
find

The frequency of small oscillations is therefore

(6.166)

(6.167)

If M (cid:6) m, then ω → 0. This makes sense. If m (cid:6) M , then ω → ∞.
Remarks:
This also makes sense, because the huge mg force makes the situation similar to one
where the wheel is bolted to the ground, in which case the wheel vibrates with a high
frequency.

Equation (6.167) can actually be derived in a much quicker way, using torque. For
small oscillations, the gravitational force on m produces a torque of −mgRθ around
the contact point on the ground. For small θ , m has essentially no moment of inertia
around the contact point, so the total moment of inertia is simply MR2. Therefore,
τ = I α gives −mgRθ = MR2 ¨θ , from which the result follows. ♣

6.14. Pendulum with a free support

Let x be the coordinate of M , and let θ be the angle of the pendulum (see Fig. 6.47).
Then the position of the mass m in Cartesian coordinates is (x + (cid:2) sin θ , −(cid:2) cos θ ).
Taking the derivative to find the velocity, and then squaring to find the speed, gives
v2

Fig. 6.47

If θ is small, we can use the small-angle approximations, cos θ ≈ 1 − θ 2/2 and
sin θ ≈ θ. Keeping only the terms that are first-order in θ , we obtain

(M + m)¨x + m(cid:2) ¨θ = 0,
¨x + (cid:2) ¨θ + gθ = 0.

(6.174)

The constant B is irrelevant, so we’ll ignore it. The two normal modes are:

• A = 0: In this case, x = −θm(cid:2)/(M +m). Both masses oscillate with the frequency
ω given in Eq. (6.173), always moving in opposite directions. The center of mass
does not move (as you can verify).

• C = 0: In this case, θ = 0 and x = At. The pendulum hangs vertically, with both
masses moving horizontally at the same speed. The frequency of oscillations is
zero in this mode.

sion in the rod is very large. We can actually be quantitative about this limit. For
small oscillations and for m (cid:6) M , the tension of mg in the rod produces a side-
ways force of mgθ on M . So the horizontal F = Ma equation for M is mgθ = M ¨x.
But x ≈ −(cid:2)θ in this limit, so we have mgθ = −M (cid:2) ¨θ , which gives the desired
frequency. ♣

6.15. Pendulum support on an inclined plane

Let z be the coordinate of M along the plane, and let θ be the angle of the pendulum
(see Fig. 6.48). In Cartesian coordinates, the positions of M and m are

(x, y)M = (z cos β, −z sin β),
(x, y)m = (z cos β + (cid:2) sin θ , −z sin β − (cid:2) cos θ ).

Differentiating these positions, we find that the squares of the speeds are

The equations of motion obtained from varying z and θ are

¨θ cos(θ + β) − ˙θ 2 sin(θ + β)

= (M + m)g sin β,

(cid:2) ¨θ + ¨z cos(θ + β) = −g sin θ .

(6.177)

(6.178)

Let us now consider small oscillations about the equilibrium point (where ¨θ = ˙θ = 0).
We must first determine where this point is. The first equation above gives ¨z = g sin β.
The second equation then gives g sin β cos(θ + β) = −g sin θ . By expanding the
cosine term, we find tan θ = − tan β, so θ = −β. (θ = π − β is also a solution, but
this is an unstable equilibrium.) The equilibrium position of the pendulum is therefore
where the string is perpendicular to the plane.14

To find the normal modes and frequencies for small oscillations, let θ ≡ −β + δ,
and expand Eq. (6.178) to first order in δ. Letting ¨η ≡ ¨z − g sin β for convenience, we
obtain

(M + m) ¨η + m(cid:2) ¨δ = 0,
¨η + (cid:2) ¨δ + (g cos β)δ = 0.
Using the determinant method (or using the method in Problem 6.14; either way works),
we find the frequencies of the normal modes to be

ω1 = 0,

and ω2 =

(6.180)

These are the same as the frequencies in the previous problem (where M moves hor-
izontally), but with g cos β in place of g; compare Eq. (6.179) with Eq. (6.170).15
Looking at Eq. (6.174), and recalling the definition of η, we see that the general
solutions for θ and z are

θ(t) = −β + C cos(ωt + φ),

z(t) = − Cm(cid:2)

(6.181)

14 This makes sense. The tension in the string is perpendicular to the plane, so for all the pendulum
bob knows, it may as well be sliding down a plane parallel to the given one, a distance (cid:2) away.
Given the same initial speed, the two masses slide down their two “planes” with equal speeds at
all times.

15 This makes sense, because in a frame that accelerates down the plane at g sin β, the only external
force on the masses is a gravitational force of g cos β perpendicular to the plane. As far as M
and m are concerned, they live in a world where gravity pulls “downward” (perpendicular to the
plane) with strength g

(cid:16) = g cos β.

6.11 Solutions

269

The constant B is irrelevant, so we’ll ignore it. The basic difference between these
normal modes and the ones in the previous problem is the acceleration down the plane.
If you go to a frame that accelerates down the plane at g sin β, and if you tilt your head
at an angle β and accept the fact that g(cid:16) = g cos β in your world, then the setup is
identical to the one in the previous problem.

6.16. Tilting plane

Relative to the support, the positions of the masses are

(x, y)M = ((cid:2) sin θ, −(cid:2) cos θ),
(x, y)m = ((cid:2) sin θ + x cos θ, −(cid:2) cos θ + x sin θ ).

(6.182)

Differentiating these positions, we find that the squares of the speeds are

(6.185)

M (cid:2)2 ¨θ + m(cid:2)((cid:2) ¨θ + ¨x) + mx2 ¨θ + 2mx˙x ˙θ = −(M + m)g(cid:2) sin θ − mgx cos θ .
Let us now consider the case where both x and θ are small (or more precisely, θ (cid:4) 1
and x/(cid:2) (cid:4) 1). Expanding Eq. (6.185) to first order in θ and x/(cid:2) gives

((cid:2) ¨θ + ¨x) + gθ = 0,
M (cid:2)((cid:2) ¨θ + gθ) + m(cid:2)((cid:2) ¨θ + ¨x) + mg(cid:2)θ + mgx = 0.
We can simplify these a bit. Using the first equation to substitute −gθ for ((cid:2) ¨θ + ¨x),
and also −¨x for ((cid:2) ¨θ + gθ), in the second equation gives

(6.186)

(cid:2) ¨θ + ¨x + gθ = 0,
−M (cid:2)¨x + mgx = 0.

(6.187)

The normal modes can be found using the determinant method, or we can find them just
by inspection. The second equation says that either x(t) ≡ 0, or x(t) = A cosh(αt +β),
where α =

mg/M (cid:2). So we have two cases:

two masses may as well be two pendulums of length (cid:2) swinging side by side.

thus outside the validity of our small-variable approximations. You can show that
in this mode the center of mass remains directly below the pivot. This can occur,
for example, by having m move down to the right as the rods rotate and swing M
up to the left. There is no oscillation in this mode; the positions keep growing.
The CM falls, to provide for the increasing kinetic energy.

Equilibrium occurs when ˙x = ¨x = 0, so Eq. (6.191) says that the equilibrium value of

The F = ma explanation for this (writing y(cid:16)(x0) as tan θ , where θ is the angle of the
curve, and then multiplying through by ω2 cos θ ) is that the component of gravity along
the curve accounts for the component of the centripetal acceleration along the curve.

As λ → ∞, we see that x0 goes to a. This makes sense, because the curve essentially

We see that λ must be greater than 2 in order for there to be oscillatory motion around
the equilibrium point. For λ < 2, the equilibrium point is unstable, that is, to the left
the force is inward, and to the right the force is outward.

For the case λ = 2, we have y(x) = b(x/a)2, so the equilibrium condition,
Eq. (6.192), gives x0 = (2gb/a2ω2)x0. For this to be true for some x0, we must
have ω2 = 2gb/a2. But if this holds, then Eq. (6.192) is true for all x. So in the special
case of λ = 2, the bead happily sits anywhere on the curve if ω2 = 2gb/a2. (In the
rotating frame of the curve, the tangential components of the centrifugal and gravita-
tional forces exactly cancel at all points.) If λ = 2 and ω2 (cid:13)= 2gb/a2, then the particle
feels a force either always inward or always outward.

Remarks: For ω → 0, Eqs. (6.193) and (6.196) give x0 → 0 and (cid:18) → 0. And for
ω → ∞, they give x0 → ∞ and (cid:18) → 0. In both cases (cid:18) → 0, because in both

6.11 Solutions

271

cases the equilibrium position is at a place where the curve is very flat (horizontally
or vertically, respectively), and the restoring force ends up being small.

For λ → ∞, we have x0 → a and (cid:18) → ∞. The frequency is large here because the
equilibrium position at a is where the curve has a sharp corner, so the restoring force
changes quickly with position. Or, you can think of it as a pendulum with a very small
length, if you approximate the “corner” by a tiny circle. ♣

6.18. Motion in a cone

If the particle’s distance from the axis is r, then its height is r/ tan α, and its distance
up along the cone is r/ sin α. Breaking the velocity into components up along the cone
and around the cone, we see that the square of the speed is v2 = ˙r2/ sin2α + r2 ˙θ 2. The

the distance up along the cone, we have ¨x = (r ˙θ 2) sin α − g cos α. This is the F = ma
statement for the diagonal x direction.

Letting mr2 ˙θ ≡ L, we can eliminate ˙θ from the second equation to obtain

¨r = L2 sin2α

− g cos α sin α.

(6.199)

We will now calculate the two desired frequencies.

• Frequency of circular oscillations, ω: For circular motion with r = r0, we have

˙r = ¨r = 0, so the second of Eqs. (6.198) gives

(cid:1)

ω ≡ ˙θ =

r = r0, then Eq. (6.199) would give (with ¨r = 0)

This is equivalent to Eq. (6.200), which can be seen by writing L as mr2

is very small, and then plugging this into Eq. (6.199) and expanding to first order
in δ. Using

This ratio (cid:18)/ω is independent of r0. The two frequencies are equal if sin α = 1/
3,
that is, if α ≈ 35.3◦ ≡ ˜α. If α = ˜α, then after one revolution around the cone, r
returns to the value it had at the beginning of the revolution. So the particle undergoes
periodic motion.

In the limit α → 0 (that is, the cone is very thin), Eq. (6.207) says that
Remarks:
(cid:18)/ω → 0. In fact, Eqs. (6.200) and (6.206) say that ω → ∞ and (cid:18) → 0. So the
particle spirals around many times during one complete r cycle. This seems intuitive.
In the limit α → π/2 (that is, the cone is almost a flat plane), both ω and (cid:18) go to

zero, and Eq. (6.207) says that (cid:18)/ω →

If (cid:18)/ω =

In the first mode, the masses essentially move equal distances in opposite direc-
tions, at a high frequency (assuming (cid:2)2 is small). The factor of 2 in the frequency
arises because the angle of (cid:2)2 is twice what it would be if m1 were bolted in
place; so m2 feels double the tangential force. In the second mode, the rods form a
straight line, and the masses move just like a mass of 2m. The system is essentially
a pendulum of length (cid:2)1.

In the first mode, the bottom mass essentially stands still, and the top mass oscil-
lates at a high frequency (assuming (cid:2)1 is small). The factor of 2 in the frequency
arises because the top mass essentially lives in a world where the acceleration
from gravity is g(cid:16) = 2g (because of the extra mg force downward from the lower
mass). In the second mode, the system is essentially a pendulum of length (cid:2)2.
The factor of 2 in the angles is what is needed to make the tangential force on
the top mass roughly equal to zero (because otherwise it would oscillate at a high
frequency, since (cid:2)1 is small).

Let the two given points be (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and let the path be described

Therefore, (x + A)2 + y2 = B, which is the equation for a circle. Note that the
circle is centered at a point with y = 0, that is, at a point on the bottom of the
slab. This is the point where the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the two
given points intersects the bottom of the slab.

6.22. Minimal surface

By “tension” in a surface, we mean the force per unit length in the surface. The
tension throughout the surface must be constant, because it is in equilibrium. If
the tension at one point were larger than at another, then some patch of the surface
between these points would move.

The ratio of the circumferences of the circular boundaries of the ring is
y2/y1. Therefore, the condition that the horizontal forces on the ring cancel is

1 + y(cid:16)2, so we have

(cid:4)

y(cid:4)

1 + y(cid:16)2

= C.

(6.233)

This is equivalent to Eq. (6.77), and the solution proceeds as in Section 6.8.

6.23. Existence of a minimal surface

The general solution for y(x) is given in Eq. (6.78) as y(x) = (1/b) cosh b(x + d).
If we choose the origin to be midway between the rings, then d = 0. Both boundary
condition are thus

r = 1
b

cosh b(cid:2).

(6.234)

We will now determine the maximum value of (cid:2)/r for which the minimal surface
exists. If (cid:2)/r is too large, then we will see that there is no solution for b in
Eq. (6.234). If you perform an experiment with soap bubbles (which want to
minimize their area), and if you pull the rings too far apart, then the surface will
break and disappear as it tries to form the two boundary circles.

Define the dimensionless quantities,

w = cosh(ηz)

w

Then Eq. (6.234) becomes

η ≡

(cid:2)

r

,

and

z ≡ br.

z = cosh ηz.

(6.235)

(6.236)

If we make a rough plot of the graphs of w = z and w = cosh ηz for a few values
of η (see Fig. 6.51), we see that there is no solution to Eq. (6.236) if η is too large.
The limiting value of η for which there exists a solution occurs when the curves
w = z and w = cosh ηz are tangent; that is, when the slopes are equal in addition
to the functions being equal. Let η0 be the limiting value of η, and let z0 be the
place where the tangency occurs. Then equality of the values and the slopes gives

z0 = cosh(η0z0),

and

1 = η0 sinh(η0z0).

(6.237)

Dividing the second of these equations by the first gives

1 = (η0z0) tanh(η0z0).

This must be solved numerically. The solution is

η0z0 ≈ 1.200.

Plugging this into the second of Eqs. (6.237) gives

(Note also that z0 = 1.200/η0 = 1.810.) We see that if (cid:2)/r is larger than
0.663, then there is no solution for y(x) that is consistent with the boundary

conditions. Above this value of (cid:2)/r, the soap bubble minimizes its area by head-
ing toward the shape of just two disks, but it will pop well before it reaches that
configuration.

To get a sense of the rough shape of the limiting minimal surface, note that the

ratio of the radius of the “middle” circle to the radius of the boundary rings is

(6.241)

Remarks:

1. We glossed over one issue above, namely that there may be more than one solution
for the constant b in Eq. (6.234). In fact, Fig. 6.51 shows that for any η < 0.663,
there are two solutions for z in Eq. (6.236), and hence two solutions for b in
Eq. (6.234). This means that there are two possible surfaces that might solve
our problem. Which one do we want? It turns out that the surface corresponding
to the smaller value of b is the one that minimizes the area, while the surface
corresponding to the larger value of b is the one that (in some sense) maximizes
the area.

We say “in some sense” because the surface with the larger b is actually a
saddle point for the area. It can’t be a maximum, after all, because we can always
make the area larger by adding little wiggles to it. It’s a saddle point because there
does exist a class of variations for which it has the maximum area, namely ones
where the “dip” in the curve is continuously made larger ( just imagine lowering
the midpoint in a smooth manner). Such a set of variations is shown in Fig. 6.52.
If we start with a cylinder for a surface and then gradually pinch in the center, the
area decreases at first (the decrease in the cross-sectional area is the dominant
effect at the start). But then as the dip becomes very deep, the area increases
because the surface starts to look like the two disks, and these two disks have a
larger area than the original narrow cylinder. The surface eventually resembles
two nearly flat cones connected by a line. As these cones finally flatten out to
the two disks, the area decreases. Therefore, the area must have achieved a local
maximum (at least with respect to this class of variations) somewhere in between.
This local maximum (or rather, saddle point) arises because the Euler–Lagrange
technique simply sets the “derivative” equal to zero and doesn’t differentiate
between maxima, minima, and saddle points.

If η ≡ (cid:2)/r > 0.663 (so that the initial cylinder in now wide instead of narrow),
there exists at least one class of variations for which the area decreases mono-
tonically from the area of the cylinder down to the area of the two disks. If you
draw a series of pictures (for a wide cylinder) analogous to those in Fig. 6.52, it
is quite believable that this is the case.

2. How does the area of the limiting surface (with η0 = 0.663) compare with the
area of the two disks? The area of the two disks is Ad = 2πr2. And the area of

Ad ≈ (6.28)r2,

and As ≈ (7.54)r2.

(6.245)

x

The ratio of As to Ad is approximately 1.2 (it’s actually η0z0, as you can show).
The limiting surface therefore has a larger area. This is expected, because for
(cid:2)/r > η0 the surface tries to run off to one with a smaller area, and there are no
other stable configurations besides the cosh solution we found. ♣

A helpful change of variables to get rid of the square root in the denominator is
y ≡ B sin2φ. Then dy = 2B sin φ cos φ dφ, and Eq. (6.249) simplifies to

2B sin2φ dφ = ± dx.

(6.250)

We can now use sin2φ = (1 − cos 2φ)/2 to integrate this. After multiplying
through by 2, the result is B(2φ − sin 2φ) = ± 2x − C, where C is a constant
of integration. Now note that we can rewrite our definition of φ (which was
y ≡ B sin2φ) as 2y = B(1 − cos 2φ). If we then define θ ≡ 2φ, we have

x = ± a(θ − sin θ ) ± d,

y = a(1 − cos θ).

(6.251)

where a ≡ B/2, and d ≡ C/2. The particle starts at (x, y) = (0, 0). Therefore, θ
starts at θ = 0, since this corresponds to y = 0. The starting condition x = 0 then
implies that d = 0. Also, we are assuming that the wire heads down to the right,
so we choose the positive sign in the expression for x. Therefore, we finally have

x = a(θ − sin θ ),

y = a(1 − cos θ),

(6.252)

as desired. This is the parametrization of a cycloid, which is the path taken by a
point on the rim of a rolling wheel. The initial slope of the y(x) curve is infinite,
as you can check.

Remark: The above method derived the parametric form in (6.252) from scratch.
But since Eq. (6.252) was given in the statement of the problem, another route is to
simply verify that this parametrization satisfies Eq. (6.248). To this end, assume that
x = a(θ − sin θ) and y = a(1 − cos θ), which gives

Central forces

A central force is by definition a force that points radially and whose magnitude
depends only on the distance from the source (that is, not on the angle around the
source).1 Equivalently, we may say that a central force is one whose potential
depends only on the distance from the source. That is, if the source is located at
the origin, then the potential energy is of the form V (r) = V (r). Such a potential
does indeed yield a central force, because

F(r) = −∇V (r) = − dV
dr

ˆr,

(7.1)

which points radially and depends only on r. Gravitational and electrostatic forces
are central forces, with V (r) ∝ 1/r. The spring force is also central, with V (r) ∝
(r − (cid:2))2, where (cid:2) is the equilibrium length.

There are two important facts concerning central forces: (1) they are ubiquitous
in nature, so we had better learn how to deal with them, and (2) dealing with them
is much easier than you might think, because crucial simplifications occur in the
equations of motion when V is a function of r only. These simplifications will
become evident in the following two sections.

7.1 Conservation of angular momentum

Angular momentum plays a key role in dealing with central forces because, as
we will show, it is constant over time. For a point mass, we define the angular
momentum L by

L = r × p,

(7.2)

where the “cross product” is defined inAppendix B. L depends on r, so it therefore
depends on where you pick the origin of your coordinate system. Note that L is
a vector, and that it is orthogonal to both r and p, by nature of the cross product.
You might wonder why we care enough about r × p to give it a name. Why not
look at r3p5r × (r × p), or something else? The answer is that L has some very
nice properties, one of which is the following.

1 Taken literally, the term “central force” would imply only the radial nature of the force. But a

physicist’s definition also includes the dependence solely on the distance from the source.

281

282

Central forces

Theorem 7.1 If a particle is subject to a central force only, then its angular
momentum is conserved.2 That is,

If V (r) = V (r),

then

dL

= 0.

(7.3)

Proof: We have

dL

(r × p)

= d

× p + r × dp

= v × (mv) + r × F
= 0,

because F ∝ r, and the cross product of two parallel vectors is zero.

(7.4)

(cid:1)

We’ll prove this theorem again in the next section, using the Lagrangian
method. Let’s now prove another theorem which is probably obvious, but good
to show anyway.

Theorem 7.2 If a particle is subject to a central force only, then its motion
takes place in a plane.

Proof: At a given instant t0, consider the plane P containing the position vec-
tor r0 (with the source of the potential taken to be the origin) and the velocity
vector v0. We claim that r lies in P at all times.3 This is true because P is
defined as the plane orthogonal to the vector n0 ≡ r0 × v0. But in the proof of
Theorem 7.1, we showed that the vector r × v ≡ (r × p)/m does not change with
time. Therefore, r × v = n0 for all t. Since r is certainly orthogonal to r × v, we
(cid:1)
see that r is orthogonal to n0 for all t. Hence, r must always lie in P.

An intuitive look at this theorem is the following. Since the position, velocity,
and acceleration (which is proportional to F, which in turn is proportional to the
position vector r) vectors initially all lie in P, there is a symmetry between the
two sides of P. Therefore, there is no reason for the particle to head out of P on
one side rather than the other. The particle therefore remains in P. We can then
use this same reasoning again a short time later, and so on.

This theorem shows that we need only two coordinates, instead of the usual
three, to describe the motion. But since we’re on a roll, why stop there? We’ll
show below that we really need only one coordinate. Not bad, three coordinates
reduced down to one.

2 This is a special case of the fact that torque equals the rate of change of angular momentum. We’ll

talk about this in great detail in Chapter 8.

3 The plane P is not well defined if v0 = 0, or if r0 = 0, or if v0 is parallel to r0. But in these cases,
you can quickly show that the motion is always radial, which is even more restrictive than planar.

7.2 The effective potential

283

7.2 The effective potential

The effective potential provides a sneaky and useful method for simplifying a
three-dimensional central-force problem down to a one-dimensional problem.
Here’s how it works. Consider a particle of mass m subject to a central force
only, described by the potential V (r). Let r and θ be the polar coordinates in
the plane of the motion. In these polar coordinates, the Lagrangian (which we’ll
label as “L”, to save “L” for the angular momentum) is

L = 1
2

m(˙r2 + r2 ˙θ 2) − V (r).

The equations of motion obtained from varying r and θ are

m¨r = mr ˙θ 2 − V

(cid:16)(r),

(mr2 ˙θ) = 0.

d
dt

(7.5)

(7.6)

Since −V (cid:16)(r) equals the force F(r), the first of these equations is the radial
F = ma equation, complete with the centripetal acceleration, in agreement with
the first of Eqs. (3.51). The second equation is the statement of conservation of
angular momentum, because mr2 ˙θ = r(mr ˙θ) = rpθ (where pθ is the momentum
in the angular direction) is the magnitude of L = r × p, from Eq. (B.9). We
therefore see that the magnitude of L is constant. And since the direction of L is
always perpendicular to the fixed plane of the motion, the vector L is constant in
time. We have therefore just given a second proof of Theorem 7.1. In the present
Lagrangian language, the conservation of L follows from the fact that θ is a
cyclic coordinate, as we saw in Example 2 in Section 6.5.1. Since mr2 ˙θ does not
change with time, let us denote its constant value by

L ≡ mr2 ˙θ.

(7.7)

L is determined by the initial conditions. It can be specified, for example, by
giving the initial values of r and ˙θ. Using ˙θ = L/(mr2), we can eliminate ˙θ from
the first of Eqs. (7.6). The result is

m¨r = L2
mr3

− V

(cid:16)(r).

Multiplying by ˙r and integrating with respect to time yields

m˙r2 +

(cid:3)

+ V (r)

= E,

(7.8)

(7.9)

where E is a constant of integration. E is simply the energy, which can be seen
by noting that this equation could also have been obtained by using Eq. (7.7) to
eliminate ˙θ in the energy equation, (m/2)(˙r2 + r2 ˙θ 2) + V (r) = E.

284

Central forces

Equation (7.9) is rather interesting. It involves only the variable r. And it
looks a lot like the equation for a particle moving in one dimension (labeled by
the coordinate r) under the influence of the potential,

+ V (r).

Veff (r) ≡ L2
2mr2
The subscript “eff” here stands for “effective.” Veff (r) is called the effective
potential. The “effective force” is easily read off from Eq. (7.8) to be
Feff (r) = L2
mr3

(7.10)

(7.11)

(cid:16)(r),

− V

which agrees with Feff = −V (cid:16)
(r), as it should. This “effective” potential
eff
concept is a marvelous result and should be duly appreciated. It says that if
we want to solve a two-dimensional problem (which could have come from a
three-dimensional problem) involving a central force, then we can recast the
problem into a simple one-dimensional problem with a slightly modified poten-
tial. We can forget that we ever had the variable θ, and we can solve this
one-dimensional problem (as we’ll demonstrate below) to obtain r(t). Hav-
ing found r(t), we can use ˙θ(t) = L/mr2 to solve for θ(t) (in theory, at
least). This whole procedure works only because there is a quantity involving
r and θ (or rather, ˙θ) that is independent of time. The variables r and θ are
therefore not independent, so the problem is really one-dimensional instead of
two-dimensional.

+ Ar2.

To get a general idea of how r behaves with time, all we have to do is draw the
graph of Veff (r). Consider the example where V (r) = Ar2. This is the potential
for a spring with relaxed length zero. Then
Veff (r) = L2
2mr2
To plot Veff (r), we must be given L (determined by the initial conditions), along
with A and m (determined by the system we’re dealing with). But the general
shape looks like the curve in Fig. 7.1. The energy E (determined by the initial
conditions), which must be given too, is also drawn. The coordinate r bounces
back and forth between the turning points, r1 and r2, which satisfy Veff (r1,2) =
E. 4 This is true because it is impossible for the particle to be located at an r
for which E < Veff , since Eq. (7.9) would then imply an imaginary value for ˙r.
If E equals the minimum of Veff (r), then r1 = r2, so r is stuck at this one value,
which means that the motion is a circle.

(7.12)

Remark: The L2/2mr2 term in the effective potential is sometimes called the angular momen-
tum barrier. It has the effect of keeping the particle from getting too close to the origin. Basically,
the point is that L ≡ mr2 ˙θ is constant, so as r gets smaller, ˙θ gets bigger. But ˙θ increases at a

4 It turns out that for our Ar2 spring potential, the motion in space is an ellipse, with semi-axis lengths

r1 and r2 (see Problem 7.5). But for a general potential, the motion isn’t so nice.

greater rate than r decreases, due to the square of the r in L = mr2 ˙θ . So eventually we end up
with a tangential kinetic energy, mr2 ˙θ 2/2, that is greater than what is allowed by conservation
of energy.5

As he walked past the beautiful belle,
The attraction was easy to tell.
But despite his persistence,
He was kept at a distance
By that darn conservation of L! ♣

Note that it is by no means necessary to introduce the concept of the effective
potential. You can simply solve the equations of motion in Eq. (7.6) as they are.
But introducing Veff makes it much easier to see what’s going on in a central-force
problem.

When using potentials, effective,
Remember the one main objective:
The goal is to shun
All dimensions but one,
And then view things with 1-D perspective.

7.3 Solving the equations of motion

If we want to be quantitative, we must solve the equations of motion in Eq. (7.6).
Equivalently, we must solve their integrated forms, Eqs. (7.7) and (7.9), which
are the conservation of L and E statements,

mr2 ˙θ = L,

1
2

m˙r2 + L2
2mr2

+ V (r) = E.

(7.13)

The word “solve” is a little ambiguous here, because we should specify what
quantities we want to solve for in terms of what other quantities. There are
essentially two things we can do. We can solve for r and θ in terms of t. Or
we can solve for r in terms of θ. The former has the advantage of immedi-
ately yielding velocities and, of course, the information of where the particle
is at time t. The latter has the advantage of explicitly showing what the trajec-
tory looks like in space, even though we don’t know how quickly it is being
traversed. We’ll deal mainly with this latter case, particularly when we dis-
cuss the gravitational force and Kepler’s laws below. But let’s look at both
cases now.

5 This argument doesn’t hold if V (r) goes to −∞ faster than −1/r2. You can see this by draw-
ing the graph of Veff (r), which heads to −∞ instead of +∞ as r → 0. V (r) decreases
fast enough to allow for the increase in kinetic energy. But such potentials don’t come up that
often.

− V (r) .

(7.14)

To get an actual r(t) out of this, we must be supplied with E and L (determined
by the initial values of r, ˙r, and ˙θ), and also the function V (r). To solve this
differential equation, we “simply” have to separate variables and then (in theory)
integrate:

m

We need to evaluate this (rather unpleasant) integral on the left-hand side, to
obtain t as a function of r. Having found t(r), we can then (in theory) invert the
result to obtain r(t). Finally, substituting this r(t) into the relation ˙θ = L/mr2
from Eq. (7.13) gives ˙θ as a function of t, which we can (in theory) integrate to
obtain θ(t).

As you might have guessed, this procedure has the potential to yield some
stress. For most V (r)’s, the integral in Eq. (7.15) is not calculable in closed form.
There are only a few “nice” potentials V (r) for which we can evaluate it. And
even in those cases, the remaining tasks are still a pain.6 But the good news
is that these “nice” potentials are precisely the ones we are most interested in.
In particular, the gravitational potential, which goes like 1/r and which we will
concentrate on during the remainder of this chapter, leads to a calculable integral
(the spring potential ∼ r2 does also). However, having said all this, we’re not
going to apply this procedure to gravity. It’s nice to know that it exists, but we
won’t be doing anything else with it. Instead, we’ll use the following strategy to
solve for r as a function of θ.

7.3.2 Finding r (θ )
We can eliminate the dt from Eqs. (7.13) by getting the ˙r2 term alone on the left
side of the second equation, and then dividing by the square of the first equation.
The dt2 factors cancel, and we obtain

We can now (in theory) take a square root, separate variables, and integrate to
obtain θ as a function of r. We can then (in theory) invert to obtain r as a function

numerically. See Section 1.4 for a discussion of this.

7.4 Gravity, Kepler’s laws

of θ. To do this, we must be given the function V (r). So let’s now finally give
ourselves a V (r) and do a problem all the way through. We’ll study the most
important potential of all, or perhaps the second most important one, gravity.7

7.4 Gravity, Kepler’s laws
7.4.1 Calculation of r (θ )
Our goal in this subsection is to obtain r as a function of θ, for a gravitational
potential. Let’s assume that we’re dealing with the earth and the sun, with masses
M(cid:21) and m, respectively. The gravitational potential energy of the earth–sun
system is

V (r) = −

α

r

, where α ≡ GM(cid:21)m.

(7.17)

In the present treatment, we’ll consider the sun to be bolted down at the origin of
our coordinate system. Since M(cid:21) (cid:6) m, this is approximately true for the earth–
sun system. (If we want to do the problem exactly, we must use the reduced mass,
which is the topic of Section 7.4.5.) Equation (7.16) becomes

(7.18)

As stated above, we could take a square root, separate variables, integrate to
find θ(r), and then invert to find r(θ). This method, although straightforward, is
rather messy. So let’s solve for r(θ) in a slick way.

With all the 1/r terms floating around, it might be easier to solve for 1/r instead
of r. Using d(1/r)/dθ = −(dr/dθ)/r2, and letting y ≡ 1/r for convenience,
Eq. (7.18) becomes

At this point, in the spirit of being slick, we can just look at Eq. (7.21) and observe
that

z = B cos(θ − θ0)

(7.23)

is the solution, because cos2x + sin2x = 1. But lest we feel guilty about not
doing separation-of-variables at least once in this problem, let’s solve Eq. (7.21)
that way, too. The integral is nice and doable, and we have

so we’ll drop the θ0 from here on. Recalling our definition z ≡ 1/r − mα/L2
and also the definition of B from Eq. (7.22), Eq. (7.23) becomes

is the eccentricity of the particle’s motion. We will see shortly exactly what
(cid:9) signifies.

This completes the derivation of r(θ) for the gravitational potential,
V (r) ∝ 1/r. It was a little messy, but not unbearably painful. At any rate,
we just discovered the basic motion of objects under the influence of gravity,
which takes care of virtually all of the gazillion tons of stuff in the universe. Not
bad for one page of work.

Newton said as he gazed off afar,
“From here to the most distant star,
These wond’rous ellipses
And solar eclipses
All come from a 1 over r.”

What are the limits on r in Eq. (7.25)? The minimum value of r is obtained
when the right-hand side reaches its maximum value, which is (mα/L2)(1 + (cid:9)).
Therefore,

rmin =

L2
mα(1 + (cid:9)) .

(7.27)

7.4 Gravity, Kepler’s laws

289

What is the maximum value of r? The answer depends on whether (cid:9) is greater
than or less than 1. If (cid:9) < 1 (which corresponds to circular or elliptical orbits, as
we’ll see below), then the minimum value of the right-hand side of Eq. (7.25) is
(mα/L2)(1 − (cid:9)). Therefore,

rmax =

L2
mα(1 − (cid:9))

(if (cid:9) < 1).

(7.28)

If (cid:9) ≥ 1 (which corresponds to parabolic or hyperbolic orbits, as we’ll see below),
then the right-hand side of Eq. (7.25) can become zero (when cos θ = −1/(cid:9)).
Therefore,

rmax = ∞ (if (cid:9) ≥ 1).

(7.29)

7.4.2 The orbits
Let’s examine in detail the various cases for (cid:9).

• Circle ((cid:9) = 0)

If (cid:9) = 0, then Eq. (7.26) says that E = −mα2/2L2. The negative E means that the poten-
tial energy is more negative than the kinetic energy is positive, so the particle is trapped
in the potential well. Equations (7.27) and (7.28) give rmin = rmax = L2/mα. There-
fore, the particle moves in a circular orbit with radius L2/mα. Equivalently, Eq. (7.25)
says that r is independent of θ .

Note that it isn’t necessary to do all the work of Section 7.4.1 if we just want to look at
circular motion. For a given L, the energy −mα2/2L2 is the minimum value that the E
given by Eq. (7.13) can take. This is true because to achieve the minimum, we certainly
want ˙r = 0. And you can show that minimizing the effective potential, L2/2mr2 − α/r,
yields this value for E. If we plot Veff (r), we have the situation shown in Fig. 7.2.
The particle is trapped at the bottom of the potential well, so it has no motion in the r
direction.

• Ellipse (0 < (cid:9) < 1)

If 0 < (cid:9) < 1, then Eq. (7.26) says that −mα2/2L2 < E < 0. Equations (7.27) and
(7.28) give rmin and rmax. It isn’t obvious that the resulting motion is an ellipse. We’ll
demonstrate this below.

If we plot Veff (r), we have the situation shown in Fig. 7.3. The particle oscillates
between rmin and rmax. The energy is negative, so the particle is trapped in the potential
well.

If (cid:9) = 1, then Eq. (7.26) says that E = 0. This value of E implies that the particle
barely makes it out to infinity (its speed approaches zero as r → ∞). Equation (7.27)
gives rmin = L2/2mα, and Eq. (7.29) gives rmax = ∞. Again, it isn’t obvious that
the resulting motion is a parabola. We’ll demonstrate this below.

If we plot Veff (r), we have the situation shown in Fig. 7.4. The particle does not
oscillate back and forth in the r direction. It moves inward (or possibly not, if it was
initially moving outward), turns around at rmin = L2/2mα, and then heads out to
infinity forever.
• Hyperbola ((cid:9) > 1)

If (cid:9) > 1, then Eq. (7.26) says that E > 0. This value of E implies that the particle
makes it out to infinity with energy to spare. The potential goes to zero as r → ∞, so
2E/m as r → ∞. Equation (7.27)
the particle’s speed approaches the nonzero value
gives rmin, and Eq. (7.29) gives rmax = ∞. Again, it isn’t obvious that the resulting
motion is a hyperbola. We’ll demonstrate this below.

If we plot Veff (r), we have the situation shown in Fig. 7.5. As in the parabola case,
the particle does not oscillate back and forth in the r direction. It moves inward (or
possibly not, if it was initially moving outward), turns around at rmin, and then heads
out to infinity forever.

7.4.3 Proof of conic orbits

Fig. 7.6

Let’s now prove that Eq. (7.25) does indeed describe the conic sections stated
above. We’ll also show that the origin (the source of the potential) is a focus
of the conic section. These proofs are straightforward, although the ellipse and
hyperbola cases get a bit messy. In what follows, we’ll find it easier to work with
Cartesian coordinates. For convenience, let
k ≡ L2
mα .

(7.30)

Multiplying Eq. (7.25) through by kr, and using cos θ = x/r, gives

k = r + (cid:9)x.

Solving for r and squaring yields

x2 + y2 = k2 − 2k(cid:9)x + (cid:9)2x2.

(7.31)

(7.32)

Let’s look at the various cases for (cid:9). We will invoke without proof various facts
about conic sections (focal lengths, etc.).

• Circle ((cid:9) = 0)

In this case, Eq. (7.32) becomes x2 + y2 = k2. So we have a circle with radius k =
L2/mα, with its center at the origin (see Fig. 7.6).

• Ellipse (0 < (cid:9) < 1)

expending some effort) as

This is the equation for an ellipse with its center located at (−k(cid:9)/(1 − (cid:9)2), 0). The
semi-major and semi-minor axes are a and b, respectively. And the focal length is
a2 − b2 = k(cid:9)/(1 − (cid:9)2). Therefore, one focus is located at the origin (see
c =

• Parabola ((cid:9) = 1)

In this case, Eq. (7.32) becomes y2 = k2−2kx, which can be written as y2 = −2k(x− k
).

This is the equation for a parabola with vertex at (k/2, 0) and focal length k/2. (The
focal length of a parabola written in the form y2 = 4ax is a.) So we have a parabola
with its focus located at the origin (see Fig. 7.8).

This is the equation for a hyperbola with its center (defined to be the intersection of the
asymptotes) located at (k(cid:9)/((cid:9)2−1), 0). The focal length is c =
a2 + b2 = k(cid:9)/((cid:9)2−1).
Therefore, the focus is located at the origin (see Fig. 7.9). Note that c/a equals the
eccentricity, (cid:9).

(cid:4)

The impact parameter (usually denoted by the letter b) of a trajectory is defined to be
the closest distance to the origin the particle would achieve if it moved in the straight line
determined by its initial velocity far from the origin (that is, along the dotted line in the
Fig. 7.9). You might think that choosing the letter b here would cause a problem, because
we already defined b in Eq. (7.34). However, it turns out that these two definitions are
identical (see Exercise 7.14), so all is well.

Equation (7.34) actually describes an entire hyperbola, that is, it also describes a
branch that opens up to the right with its focus located at (2k(cid:9)/((cid:9)2 − 1), 0). However,
this right branch was introduced in the squaring operation that produced Eq. (7.32). It
isn’t a solution to the original equation we wanted to solve, Eq. (7.31). It turns out that
the right-opening branch (or its reflection across the y axis, depending on your sign
convention for B and (cid:9)) is relevant for a repulsive, instead of attractive, 1/r potential;
see Exercise 7.21.

7.4.4 Kepler’s laws

We can now, with minimal extra work, write down Kepler’s laws. Kepler (1571–
1630) lived before Newton (1642–1727), so he didn’t have Newton’s laws at his
disposal. Kepler arrived at his laws via observational data, which was a rather
impressive feat. It was known since the time of Copernicus (1473–1543) that
the planets move around the sun, but it was Kepler who first gave a quantitative
description of the orbits. Kepler’s laws assume that the sun is massive enough so
that its position is essentially fixed in space. This is a very good approximation,

292

Fig. 7.10

but the following subsection on the reduced mass shows how to modify the laws
and solve things exactly.

• First law: The planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.

We proved this in Eq. (7.33).8 There are undoubtedly also objects flying past the sun in
hyperbolic orbits, but we don’t call these things planets, because we never see the same
one twice.

• Second law: The radius vector to a planet sweeps out area at a rate that is independent

of its position in the orbit.

This law is nothing other than a fancy way of stating conservation of angular
momentum. The area swept out by the radius vector during a short period of time
is dA = r(r dθ )/2, because r dθ is the base of the thin triangle in Fig. 7.10. Therefore,
we have (using L = mr2 ˙θ)

dA
dt

= r2 ˙θ
2

= L
2m

,

(7.35)

which is constant, because L is constant for a central force. This quick proof is
independent of all the work we did in Sections 7.4.1–7.4.3.

• Third law: The square of the period of an orbit, T , is proportional to the cube of the

semi-major-axis length, a. More precisely,

T 2 = 4π 2a3
GM(cid:21)

,

(7.36)

where M(cid:21) is the mass of the sun. Note that the planet’s mass m doesn’t appear in this
equation.
Proof: Integrating Eq. (7.35) over the time of a whole orbit gives

A = LT
2m

.

(7.37)

But the area of an ellipse is A = πab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor
axes, respectively. Squaring Eq. (7.37) and using Eq. (7.33) to write b = a
1 − (cid:9)2
gives

(cid:4)

π 2a4 =

(cid:9)

L2
m(1 − (cid:9)2)

(cid:10)

T 2
4m

.

(7.38)

We have grouped the right-hand side in this way because we can now use the L2 ≡ mαk
relation from Eq. (7.30) to transform the term in parentheses into αk/(1 − (cid:9)2) ≡ αa,
where a is given in Eq. (7.33). But αa ≡ (GM(cid:21)m)a, so we obtain

π 2a4 =

(GM(cid:21)ma)T 2
4m

,

which gives Eq. (7.36), as desired.

Goodstein (1996).

7.4 Gravity, Kepler’s laws

293

These three laws describe the motion of all the planets (and asteroids, comets,
and such) in the solar system. But our solar system is only the tip of the iceberg.
There’s a lot of other stuff out there, and it’s all governed by gravity (although
Newton’s inverse square law must be supplanted by Einstein’s General Relativity
theory of gravitation). There’s a whole universe around us, and as time passes on
we see and understand more and more of it, both experimentally and theoretically.
In recent years, we’ve even begun to look for friends we might have out there.
Why? Because we can. There’s nothing wrong with looking under the lamppost
now and then. It just happens to be a very big one in this case.

As we grow up, we open an ear,
Exploring the cosmic frontier.
In this coming of age,
We turn in our cage,
All alone on a tiny blue sphere.

7.4.5 Reduced mass

We assumed in Section 7.4.1 that the sun is large enough so that it is only
negligibly affected by the presence of the planets. That is, it is essentially
fixed at the origin. But how do we solve a problem in which the masses of
the two interacting bodies are comparable in size? Equivalently, how do we
solve the earth–sun problem exactly? It turns out that the only modification
required is a replacement of the earth’s mass with the reduced mass, defined
below. The following discussion actually holds for any central force, not just
gravity.

The Lagrangian of a general central-force system consisting of the interacting

masses m1 and m2 is

L = 1
2

m1 ˙r2
1

+ 1
2

m2 ˙r2
2

− V (|r1 − r2|).

(7.40)

We have written the potential in this form, dependent only on the distance |r1−r2|,
because we are assuming a central force. Let us define

R ≡ m1r1 + m2r2
m1 + m2

,

and

r ≡ r1 − r2.

(7.41)

R and r are the position of the center of mass and the vector between the masses,
respectively. Invert these equations to obtain

r1 = R + m2
M

r,

and

r2 = R − m1
M

r,

(7.42)

where M ≡ m1 + m2 is the total mass of the system. In terms of R and r, the
Lagrangian becomes

(7.43)

where the reduced mass, µ, is defined by

.

1

+ 1
m2

≡ 1
m1
We now note that the Lagrangian in Eq. (7.43) depends on ˙R, but not on R.
Therefore, the Euler–Lagrange equations say that ˙R is constant. That is, the CM
moves at constant velocity (this is just the statement that there are no external
forces). The CM motion is therefore trivial, so let’s ignore it. Our Lagrangian
therefore becomes

(7.44)

L → 1
2

µ˙r2 − V (r).

(7.45)

But this is simply the Lagrangian for a particle of mass µ that moves around a
fixed origin under the influence of the potential V (r). For gravity, we have

L = 1
2

µ˙r2 +

α

r

(where α ≡ GM(cid:21)m).

(7.46)

To solve the earth–sun system exactly, we therefore just need to replace (in the
calculation in Section 7.4.1) the earth’s mass, m, with the reduced mass, µ,
given by

1
µ

≡ 1
m

+ 1
M(cid:21)

.

(7.47)

The resulting value of r in Eq. (7.25) is the distance between the earth and sun.
The earth and sun are therefore distances of (M(cid:21)/M )r and (m/M )r, respectively,
away from the CM, from Eq. (7.42). These distances are just scaled-down versions
of the distance r, which represents an ellipse, so we see that the earth and sun
move in elliptical orbits (whose sizes are in the ratio M(cid:21)/m) with the CM as a
focus. Note that the m’s that are buried in L and (cid:9) in Eq. (7.25) must be changed
to µ’s. But α is still defined to be GM(cid:21)m, so the m in this definition does not get
replaced with µ.

For the earth–sun system, the µ in Eq. (7.47) is essentially equal to m, because
M(cid:21) is so large. Using m = 5.97 · 1024 kg, and M(cid:21) = 1.99 · 1030 kg, we find that

7.4 Gravity, Kepler’s laws

295

µ is smaller than m by only one part in 3 · 105. Our fixed-sun approximation is
therefore a very good one. You can show that the CM is about 5 · 105 m from
the center of the sun, which is well inside the sun (about a thousandth of the
radius).

How are Kepler’s laws modified when we solve for the orbits exactly using

the reduced mass?

• First law: The elliptical statement in the first law is still true, but with the CM
(not the sun) located at a focus. The sun also travels in an ellipse with the CM at
a focus.9 Whatever is true for the earth must also be true for the sun, because they
come into Eq. (7.43) symmetrically. The only difference is in the size of various
quantities.

• Second law: In the second law, we need to consider the position vector from the CM
(not the sun) to the earth. This vector sweeps out equal areas in equal times, because the
angular momentum of the earth (and the sun, too) relative to the CM is constant. This
is true because the gravitational force always points through the CM, so the force is a
central force with the CM chosen as the origin.

• Third law: The period of the earth’s orbit (and the sun’s, too) is the same as the period of
the orbit of our hypothetical particle of mass µ orbiting around a fixed origin under the
influence of the potential −α/r ≡ −GM(cid:21)m/r. This is true because the radius vectors in
all three of these systems are always in the same ratio. To find the period of the particle’s
orbit, we can repeat the derivation leading up to Eq. (7.39). But in that equation, the m
on the bottom is replaced by µ, while the m on the top remains m, because this is the m
that appears in α. Therefore, we obtain10

T 2 =

4π 2a3
µµ
GM(cid:21)m

=

4π 2a3
µ
GM

,

(7.48)

where we have used µ ≡ M(cid:21)m/(M(cid:21) + m) ≡ M(cid:21)m/M . This result is symmetric in
M(cid:21) and m, as it must be because if we interchange the labels of M(cid:21) and m, we still
have the same system. And it also correctly reduces to Eq. (7.36) when M(cid:21) (cid:6) m.

If you want to write Eq. (7.48) in terms of the semi-major axis of the earth’s elliptical

orbit, which is aE = (M(cid:21)/M )aµ, then just plug in aµ = (M /M(cid:21))aE to obtain

T 2 = 4π 2(M /M(cid:21))3a3

(7.49)

Let’s perform a check on this formula by considering the special case of equal masses
m orbiting around the same circular path of radius r (at diametrically opposite points)

9 Well, this statement is true only if there is just one planet. With many planets, the tiny motion of
the sun is very complicated. This is perhaps the best reason to work in the approximation where
it is essentially bolted down.

10 We have put the subscript µ on the length a to remind us that it is the semi-major axis of our

hypothetical particle’s orbit, and not the semi-major axis of the earth’s orbit.

296

with their CM at the center of the circle. For this simple system, we can solve for the
period from scratch using F = ma:

,

(7.50)

which agrees with Eq. (7.49), in different notation, when M = 2M(cid:21).

Remark: There’s actually a fairly quick way to see where the M 2/M 2
(cid:21) factor in Eq. (7.49)
comes from. Imagine a new system where the earth’s orbit has the same dimensions but
where the (slightly) moving sun is replaced by a stationary mass bolted down at the location
of the earth–sun CM. This new mass is now a fraction M(cid:21)/M as far away from the earth
as the sun was. Therefore, since the gravitational force is proportional to 1/r2, if we make
our new mass equal to (M(cid:21)/M )2M(cid:21), then it will exert the same force on the earth that the
sun exerted. So if mother earth has her eyes closed, she’ll never know the difference. The
periods of these two systems must therefore be the same. But from Eq. (7.36), the period of
the second system, which has a bolted-down mass, is

T 2 =

4π 2a3
E
G · (M(cid:21)/M )2M(cid:21)

in agreement with Eq. (7.49) . ♣

L2 = (2mV0λ2)r4e

(7.62)
This implicitly determines r. As long as L isn’t too large, Veff (r) looks something
like the graph in Fig. 7.12, although it doesn’t necessarily dip down to negative
values; see the remark below. You can arrive at this picture by noting that for any
L, Veff (r) behaves like 1/r2 for both r → 0 and r → ∞; and for sufficiently
small L, Veff (r) reaches negative values somewhere in between, due to the
−V0 term. The curve must therefore look like the one shown, which has two
locations where V (cid:16)
(r) = 0. The smaller solution is the one with the stable orbit.
eff
However, if L is too large, then there are no solutions to V (cid:16)
(r) = 0, because
eff
Veff (r) decreases monotonically to zero (because L2/2mr2 does so). We’ll be
quantitative about this in part (b).

(b) The function r4e−λ2r2

on the right-hand side of Eq. (7.62) has a maximum
value, because it goes to zero for both r → 0 and r → ∞. Therefore, there
is a maximum value of L for which a solution for r exists. The maximum of
r4e−λ2r2

Remark: A common error in this problem is to say that the condition for a
circular orbit to exist is that Veff (r) < 0 at the point where Veff (r) is minimum.

The logic here is that since the goal is to have a well in which the particle can be
trapped, it seems like we just need Veff to achieve a value less than the value at

r = ∞, namely 0. However, this gives the wrong answer (L2
as you can show), because Veff (r) can look like the graph in Fig. 7.14. This has
a local minimum with Veff (r) > 0. ♣

7.4. rk potential

(a) A circular orbit exists at the value of r for which the derivative of the effective
potential (which is the negative of the effective force) is zero. This is simply the
statement that the right-hand side of Eq. (7.8) equals zero, so that ¨r = 0. Since
V (cid:16)(r) = βkrk−1, Eq. (7.8) gives

L2

− βkrk−1 = 0 =⇒ r0 =

(cid:3)1/(k+2)

mβk

.

(7.66)

If k is negative, then β must also be negative if there is to be a real solution
for r0.

(b) The long method of finding the frequency is to set r(t) ≡ r0 + (cid:9)(t), where
(cid:9) represents the small deviation from the circular orbit, and to then plug this
expression for r into Eq. (7.8). The result (after making some approximations) is
(cid:9). This general procedure,
a harmonic-oscillator equation of the form ¨(cid:9) = −ω2
r
which was described in detail in Section 6.7, will work fine here (as you are
encouraged to show), but let’s use an easier method.

By introducing the effective potential, we have reduced the problem to a one-
dimensional problem in the variable r. Therefore, we can make use of the result
in Section 5.2, where we found in Eq. (5.20) that to find the frequency of small
oscillations, we just need to calculate the second derivative of the potential. For
the problem at hand, we must use the effective potential, because that is what
determines the motion of the variable r. We therefore have

(cid:13)

ωr =

V (cid:16)(cid:16)
eff

(r0)
m

.

(7.67)

If you work through the r ≡ r0 + (cid:9) method described above, you will find
that you are basically calculating the second derivative of Veff , but in a rather
cumbersome way.

Using the form of the effective potential, we have

(7.69)

We could get rid of the r0 here by using Eq. (7.66), but this form of ωr will be
more useful in part (c).

Note that we must have k > −2 for ωr to be real. If k < −2, then V (cid:16)(cid:16)
eff

(r0) < 0,
which means that we have a local maximum of Veff , instead of a local minimum.
In other words, the circular orbit is unstable. Small perturbations grow, instead
of oscillating around zero.

˙θ for the circular orbit, we have ωθ ≡ ˙θ = L/(mr2

). Combining

(c) Since L = mr2

this with Eq. (7.69), we find

k = -7/4

Fig. 7.15

A few values of k that yield rational values for this ratio are (the plots of the
orbits are shown in Fig. 7.15):

• k = −1 =⇒ ωr/ωθ = 1: This is the gravitational potential. The variable r
makes one oscillation for each complete revolution of the (nearly) circular
orbit.

• k = 2 =⇒ ωr/ωθ = 2: This is the spring potential. The variable r makes

two oscillations for each complete revolution.

• k = 7 =⇒ ωr/ωθ = 3: The variable r makes three oscillations for each

complete revolution.

• k = −7/4 =⇒ ωr/ωθ = 1/2: The variable r makes half of an oscillation
for each complete revolution. So we need to have two revolutions to get
back to the same value of r.

There is an infinite number of k values that yield closed orbits. But note that
this statement applies only to orbits that are nearly circular. Also, the “closed”
nature of the orbits is only approximate, because it is based on Eq. (7.67) which
is an approximate result based on small oscillations. The only k values that
lead to exactly closed orbits for any initial conditions are k = −1 (gravity) and
k = 2 (spring), and in both cases the orbits are ellipses. This result is known as
Bertrand’s theorem; see Brown (1978).

As stated in Section 7.4.1, we could take a square root, separate variables, integrate to
find θ (r), and then invert to find r(θ). But let’s solve for r(θ) in a slick way, as we
did for the gravitational case, where we made the change of variables, y ≡ 1/r. Since
there are lots of r2 terms floating around in Eq. (7.71), it’s reasonable to try the change
of variables, y ≡ r2 or y ≡ 1/r2. The latter turns out to be the better choice. So, using
y ≡ 1/r2 and dy/dθ = −2(dr/dθ)/r3, and multiplying Eq. (7.71) through by 1/r2,

an ellipse. For convenience, let

This is the equation for an ellipse with its center located at the origin (as opposed to a

2k(cid:9)/(1 − (cid:9)2). The eccentricity is c/b =

If (cid:9) = 0, then a = b, which means that the ellipse is actually a circle. Let’s
Remark:
see if this makes sense. Looking at Eq. (7.76), we see that we want to show that circular
motion implies 2βL2 = mE2. For circular motion, the radial F = ma equation is
mv2/r = 2βr =⇒ v2 = 2βr2/m. The energy is therefore E = mv2/2 + βr2 = 2βr2.
Also, the square of the angular momentum is L2 = m2v2r2 = 2mβr4. Therefore,
2βL2 = 2β(2mβr4) = m(2βr2)2 = mE2, as we wanted to show. ♣

θ = 0 and θ = π/a make the right-hand side equal to zero, so they correspond to
r = ∞. And θ = π/2a makes the right-hand side maximum, so it corresponds to
the minimum value of r, which is rmin = a
L2/2mE. This minimum r can also be
obtained in a much quicker manner by finding where Veff (r) = E.

If the particle comes in from infinity at θ = 0, it eventually heads back out to infinity
at θ = π/a. The angle that the outgoing path makes with the incoming path is therefore
π/a. So if a is large (that is, if β is large and positive, or if L is small), then the particle
bounces nearly straight backward. If a is small (that is, if β is negative and if L2 is
only slightly larger than −2mβ), then the particle spirals around many times before it
pops back out to infinity.

A few special cases are: (1) β = 0 =⇒ a = 1, which means that the total angle
is π, that is, there is no net deflection. In fact, the particle’s path is a straight line,
because the potential is zero; see Exercise 7.19. (2) L2 = −8mβ/3 =⇒ a = 1/2,
which means that the total angle is 2π, that is, the final line of the particle’s motion
is (anti)parallel to the initial line. These lines are shifted sideways from one another,
with the separation depending on the initial conditions.

Unlike the a2 > 0 case above, the sinh function has no maximum value. Therefore,

the initial ˙r is negative. It does so in a finite time, because ˙r only becomes more
negative as time goes by, from Fig. 7.19. For large z, we have sinh z ≈ ez/2, so
r heads to zero like e−bθ . The particle will therefore spiral around the origin an
infinite number of times (because θ → ∞ as r → 0).

when θ = 0. So r achieves a maximum value (if the initial ˙r is positive) equal to
rmax = b
L2/2m|E|. This is clear from Fig. 7.20. This maximum r can also be
obtained by simply finding where Veff (r) = E. After reaching rmax, the particle

is, only a small area gets deflected backward. This makes sense, because the
particle is more likely to fly past M without much deflection if it is moving fast,
because the force has hardly any time to act. The particle needs to start with a
very small b value (which corresponds to a very small area) in order to get close
enough to M to allow there to be a large enough force to swing it around.

Another special case is φ ≈ 0, that is, negligible deflection. In this case,
Eq. (7.95) tells us that the amount of area that gets scattered into a nearly forward
solid angle of d(cid:18) is dσ ≈ ∞. This makes sense, because if the impact parameter
b is large (and there is an infinite cross-sectional area for which this is true), then

the particle will hardly feel the mass M , so it will continue to move essentially
in a straight line.14

What if we consider the electrostatic force, instead of the gravitational force?
What is the differential cross section in this case? To answer this, note that we
can rewrite γ as

In the case of electrostatics, the force takes the form, Fe = kq1q2/r2. This
looks like the gravitational force, Fg = Gm1m2/r2, except that the constant
α is now kq1q2, instead of Gm1m2. Therefore, the γ in Eq. (7.96) becomes
γe = 2E/(kq1q2). Substituting this into Eq. (7.94), or equivalently replacing
GMm by kq1q2 in Eq. (7.95), gives the differential cross section for electrostatic
scattering,

This is the Rutherford-scattering differential-cross-section formula. Around
1910, Rutherford and his students bombarded metal foils with alpha particles.
Their results for the distribution of scattering angles were consistent with the
above formula. In particular, they observed backward scattering of the alpha
particles. Since the above formula is based on the assumption of a point source
for the potential, this led Rutherford to his theory that atoms contained a dense
positively charged nucleus, as opposed to being made of a spread-out “plum
pudding” distribution of charge, which (as a special case of not yielding the
correct distribution of scattering angles in general) doesn’t yield backward
scattering. ♣

14 Remember, all we care about is the angle here. So when you’re picturing the large sphere of radius
R centered at M , don’t say, “If b is large (for example, R/2), then a straight-line trajectory will hit
).” This is incorrect. If you want
the sphere at a large angle up above the x axis (for example, 30
to think in terms of a physical sphere of radius R, it is understood that R is infinitely large. Or
more precisely, R (cid:6) b, for any impact parameter b you might choose. So even if b is “large,” it is
still small compared with R, so a straight-line trajectory will hit the sphere of radius R at an angle
that is essentially zero. Alternatively, you can just think in terms of angles, and not visualize an
actual large sphere centered at M .

Chapter 8
Angular momentum, Part I
(Constant ˆL)

The angular momentum of a point mass, relative to a given origin, is defined by

L = r × p.

(8.1)

For a collection of particles,
the total L is simply the sum of the L’s of
all the particles. The vector r × p is a useful thing to study because it has
many nice properties. One of these is the conservation law presented in The-
orem 7.1, which allowed us to introduce the “effective potential” in Section
7.2. And later in this chapter we will introduce the concept of torque, τ,
which appears in the bread-and-butter statement, τ = dL/dt (analogous to
Newton’s F = dp/dt law).

There are two basic types of angular momentum problems in the world. Since
the solution to any rotational problem invariably comes down to using τ = dL/dt,
as we will see, we must determine how L changes in time. And since L is a vector,
it can change because (1) its length changes, or (2) its direction changes (or
through some combination of these effects). In other words, if we write L = L ˆL,
where ˆL is the unit vector in the L direction, then L can change because L changes,
or because ˆL changes, or both.

The first of these cases, that of constant ˆL, is the easily understood one.
Consider a spinning record, with the center chosen as the origin. The vector
r × p is perpendicular to the record, because every term in the sum has
L =
this property. If we give the record a tangential force in the proper direction, then
it will speed up (in a precise way which we will soon determine). There is nothing
mysterious going on here. If we push on the record, it goes faster. L points in the
same direction as before, but now simply with a larger magnitude. In fact, in this
type of problem, we can completely forget that L is a vector. We can deal just
with its magnitude L, and everything will be fine. This first case is the subject of
the present chapter.

(cid:26)

The second case, however, where L changes direction, can get rather con-
fusing. This is the subject of the following chapter, where we will talk about
twirling tops and other kinds of spinning objects that have a tendency to make
one’s head spin too. In these situations, the entire point is that L is actually a

309

310

Angular momentum, Part I (Constant ˆL)

vector. And unlike in the constant- ˆL case, we really have to visualize things in
three dimensions to see what’s going on.1

The angular momentum of a point mass is given by the simple expression in
Eq. (8.1). But in order to deal with setups in the real world, which invariably
consist of many particles, we must learn how to calculate the angular momentum
of an extended object. This is the task of the Section 8.1. In this chapter, we’ll
deal only with rotations around the z axis, or an axis parallel to the z axis. We’ll
save the general 3-D motion for Chapter 9.

Consider a flat rigid body undergoing arbitrary motion (both translating and
spinning) in the x-y plane; see Fig. 8.1. What is the angular momentum of this
body, relative to the origin of the coordinate system?2 If we imagine the body to
consist of particles of mass mi, then the angular momentum of the entire body is
the sum of the angular momenta of each mi, which is Li = ri × pi. So the total
angular momentum is

L =

(cid:19)

i

ri × pi.

(8.2)

Fig. 8.1

For a continuous distribution of mass, we would have an integral instead of a
sum. L depends on the locations and momenta of the masses. The momenta in
turn depend on how fast the body is translating and spinning. Our goal here is
to find the dependence of L on the distribution and motion of the constituent
masses. The result will involve the geometry of the body in a specific way, as we
will show.

In this section, we will deal only with pancake-like objects that move in the
x-y plane. We will calculate L relative to the origin, and we will also derive
an expression for the kinetic energy. We will deal with non-pancake objects in
Section 8.2. Note that since both the r and p of all the masses in our pancake-like
objects always lie in the x-y plane, the vector L =
r × p always points in
the ˆz direction. As mentioned above, this fact is what makes these pancake cases
easy to deal with. L changes only because its length changes, not its direction.
So when we eventually get to the τ = dL/dt equation, it will take on a simple
form. Let’s first look at a special case, and then we’ll look at general motion in
the x-y plane.

(cid:26)

1 The difference between these two cases is essentially the same as the difference between the two
basic F = dp/dt cases. The vector p can change because its magnitude changes, in which case
we have F = ma (assuming that m is constant). Or, p can change because its direction changes,
in which case we have the centripetal-acceleration statement, F = mv2/r. (Or there could be a
combination of these effects.) The former case seems a bit more intuitive than the latter.

2 Remember, L is defined relative to a chosen origin, because it has the vector r in it. So it makes

no sense to ask what L is, without specifying what origin we’ve chosen.

8.1.1 Rotation about the z axis
The pancake in Fig. 8.2 is pivoted at the origin and rotates with angular speed ω
around the z axis, in the counterclockwise direction (as viewed from above).
Consider a little piece of the body, with mass dm and position (x, y). This
little piece travels in a circle around the origin with speed v = ωr, where
r =
x2 + y2. Therefore, the angular momentum of this piece (relative to the
origin) equals L = r × p = r(v dm)ˆz = dm r2ωˆz. The ˆz direction arises from
the cross product of the (orthogonal) vectors r and p. The angular momentum of
the entire body is therefore
(cid:14)

(cid:4)

(cid:14)

L =

r2ωˆz dm =

(x2 + y2)ωˆz dm,

(8.3)

where the integration runs over the area of the body. If the density of the object
is constant, as is usually the case, then we have dm = ρ dx dy. If we define the
moment of inertia around the z axis to be
(cid:14)

(cid:14)

Iz ≡

r2 dm =

(x2 + y2) dm,

then the z component of L is

Lz = Izω,

(8.4)

(8.5)

and both Lx and Ly are zero. In the case where the rigid body is made up of a
collection of point masses mi in the x-y plane, the moment of inertia in Eq. (8.4)
takes the discretized form,

Iz ≡

(cid:19)

i

mir2
i .

(8.6)

Given any rigid body in the x-y plane, we can calculate Iz. And given ω, we
can then multiply it by Iz to find Lz. In Section 8.3.1, we’ll get some practice
calculating various moments of inertia.

What is the kinetic energy of our object? We need to add up the energies of
all the little pieces. A little piece has energy dm v2/2 = dm(rω)2/2. So the total
kinetic energy is

T =

With our definition of Iz in Eq. (8.4), this becomes

8.1.2 General motion in x -y plane

How do we deal with general motion in the x-y plane? For the motion in Fig. 8.3,
where the object is both translating and spinning, the various pieces of mass don’t
travel in circles around the origin, so we can’t write v = ωr as we did above.
It turns out to be highly advantageous to write the angular momentum, L, and
the kinetic energy, T , in terms of the center-of-mass (CM) coordinates and the
coordinates relative to the CM. The expressions for L and T take on very nice
forms when written this way, as we now show.

Let the position of the CM relative to a fixed origin be R = (X , Y ). And let
the position of a given point relative to the CM be r(cid:16) = (x(cid:16), y(cid:16)). Then the position
of the given point relative to the fixed origin is r = R + r(cid:16) (see Fig. 8.4). Let
the velocity of the CM be V, and let the velocity relative to the CM be v(cid:16). Then
v = V + v(cid:16). Let the body rotate with angular speed ω(cid:16) around the CM (around
an instantaneous axis parallel to the z axis, so that the pancake remains in the x-y
plane at all times).3 Then v(cid:16) = ω(cid:16)r(cid:16).

Let’s look at L first. Let M be the total mass of the pancake. The angular

momentum relative to the origin is

r(cid:16) × V dm and
(cid:17)
r(cid:16) dm = 0.
(See Eq. (5.58); basically, the position of the CM in the CM frame is zero.) This
r(cid:16) dm)/dt also equals zero. And since we can pull the
implies that
constant vectors V and R out of the above integrals, we are therefore left with
zero. The quantity I CM
in the final result is the moment of inertia around an axis
through the CM, parallel to the z axis. Equation (8.9) is a very nice result, and it
is important enough to be called a theorem. In words, it says:

Theorem 8.2 The kinetic energy of a body can be found by treating the body
like a point mass located at the CM, and by then adding on the kinetic energy of
the body due to the motion relative to the CM. 5

To calculate E, my dear class,
Just add up two things, and you’ll pass.
Take the CM point’s E,
And then add on with glee,
The E ’round the center of mass.

Example (Cylinder on a ramp): A cylinder of mass m, radius r, and moment of
inertia I = (1/2)mr2 (this is the I for a solid cylinder around its center, as we’ll see
in Section 8.3.1) rolls without slipping down a plane inclined at an angle θ. What is
the acceleration of the center of the cylinder?

4 This theorem works only if we use the CM as the location of the imagined point mass. True, in
the above analysis we could have chosen a point P other than the CM, and then written things
in terms of the coordinates of P and the coordinates relative to P (which could also be described
by a rotation). But then the cross terms in Eq. (8.9) wouldn’t vanish, and we’d end up with an
unenlightening mess.

5 We already knew this from Section 5.6.2. It’s just that now we know that the kinetic energy in the

CM frame takes the form of I CM

Angular momentum, Part I (Constant ˆL)

Solution: We’ll use conservation of energy to determine the speed v of the center
of the cylinder after it has moved a distance d down the plane, and then we’ll read
off a from the standard constant-acceleration kinematic relation, v =

2ad.

√

The loss in potential energy of the cylinder is mgd sin θ. This shows up as kinetic
energy, which equals mv2/2+I ω2/2 from Theorem 8.2. But the nonslipping condition
is v = ωr. Therefore, ω = v/r, and conservation of energy gives

Remarks: Our answer is 2/3 of the g sin θ result for a block sliding down a frictionless
plane. It is smaller because there is kinetic energy “wasted” in the rotational motion.
Alternatively, it is smaller because there is a friction force pointing up the plane (to provide
the torque necessary to get the cylinder rotating, but we’ll talk about torque in Section 8.4),
so this decreases the net force down the plane.

If we let I take the general form I = βmr2, where β is a numerical factor, then you can
g sin θ/(1 + β). So if β = 0 (all the mass is at
show that the acceleration becomes a =
the center), then we simply have a = g sin θ , so the cylinder behaves just like a sliding
block. If β = 1 (all the mass is on the rim), then a = (1/2)g sin θ . If β → ∞,6 then
a → 0. After reading Section 8.4, you can think about these special cases alternatively in
terms of the forces and torques involved.

(cid:4)

Although this problem can also be solved by using force and torque (the task of Exer-
cise 8.37), the conservation-of-energy method is generally quicker in more complicated
problems of this type, as you can see by doing, for example, Exercises 8.28 and 8.46. ♣

Consider the special case where the CM rotates around the origin at the same
rate as the body rotates around the CM. This can be achieved, for example, by
gluing a stick across the pancake and pivoting one end of the stick at the origin;
see Fig. 8.5. In this special case, we have the simplified situation where all points
in the pancake travel in circles around the origin. Let their angular speed be ω.
Then the speed of the CM is V = ωR, so Eq. (8.9) gives the angular momentum
around the origin as

Lz = (MR2 + I CM

)ω.

(8.12)

Fig. 8.5

6 This can be obtained by adding on long spokes protruding from the cylinder and having them pass
through a deep groove in the plane, or by having a spool with a very small inner radius roll down
a thin plane with only its inner “axle” rolling on the plane.

8.1 Pancake object in x -y plane

In other words, the moment of inertia around the origin is

Iz = MR2 + I CM

z

.

(8.13)

This is the parallel-axis theorem. It says that once you’ve calculated the moment
of inertia of an object around the axis passing through the CM (namely I CM
),
then if you want to calculate the moment of inertia around a parallel axis, you
simply have to add on MR2, where R is the distance between the two axes, and
M is the mass of the object. Note that since the parallel-axis theorem is a special
case of the result in Eq. (8.9), it is valid only with the CM, and not with any other
point. The parallel-axis theorem actually holds for arbitrary nonplanar objects
too, as we’ll see in Section 8.2. And we’ll also derive a more general form of the
theorem in Chapter 9.

We can also look at the kinetic energy in this special case where the CM
rotates around the origin at the same rate as the body rotates around the CM.

and length (cid:2), in the case where we want to compare the moment of inertia around an

axis through the CM (perpendicular to the stick).

For convenience, let ρ = m/(cid:2) be the density. The moment of inertia around an axis

8.1.4 The perpendicular-axis theorem

x

This theorem is valid only for pancake objects. Consider a pancake object in the
x-y plane (see Fig. 8.6). Then the perpendicular-axis theorem says that

Iz = Ix + Iy,

(8.18)

where Ix and Iy are defined analogously to the Iz in Eq. (8.4). That is, to find Ix,
imagine spinning the object around the x axis at angular speed ω, and then define
Ix ≡ Lx/ω. (Only the distance from the x axis matters in calculating the speed of
a given point. So the fact that the object has extent along the x direction and is
therefore not a pancake in the y-z plane is irrelevant. The following section has
further discussion of this.) Likewise for Iy. In other words,

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

Ix ≡

(y2 + z2) dm,

Iy ≡

(z2 + x2) dm,

Iz ≡

(x2 + y2) dm.

(8.19)

To prove the perpendicular-axis theorem, we simply use the fact that z = 0
for our pancake object. Equation (8.19) then gives Iz = Ix + Iy. In the limited
number of situations where this theorem is applicable, it can save you some
trouble. A few examples are given in Section 8.3.1.

8.2 Nonplanar objects

In Section 8.1, we restricted the discussion to pancake objects in the x-y plane.
However, nearly all the results we derived carry over to nonplanar objects, pro-
vided that the axis of rotation is parallel to the z axis, and provided that we are
concerned only with Lz, and not Lx or Ly. So let’s drop the pancake assumption
and run through the results we obtained above.

First, consider an object rotating around the z axis. Let the object have exten-
sion in the z direction. If we imagine slicing the object into pancakes parallel to
the x-y plane, then Eqs. (8.4) and (8.5) correctly give the Lz for each pancake.
And since the Lz of the whole object is the sum of the Lz’s of all the pancakes,
we see that the Iz of the whole object is the sum of the Iz’s of all the pancakes.
The difference in the z values of the pancakes is irrelevant. Therefore, for any
object rotating around the z axis, we have

(cid:14)

Iz =

(x2 + y2) dm,

and Lz = Izω,

(8.20)

where the integration runs over the entire volume of the body. We’ll calculate the
Iz for many nonplanar objects in Section 8.3.1. Note that even though Eq. (8.20)
gives the Lz for an arbitrary object, the analysis in this chapter is still not com-
pletely general because (1) we are restricting the axis of rotation to be the (fixed)
z axis, and (2) even with this restriction, an object outside the x-y plane might

8.2 Nonplanar objects

317

have nonzero x and y components of L, but we found only the z component in
Eq. (8.20). This second fact is strange but true. We’ll deal with it in great detail
in Section 9.2.

As far as the kinetic energy goes, the T for a nonplanar object rotating around
the z axis is still given by Eq. (8.8), because we can obtain the total T by adding
up the T ’s of all the pancake slices.

Also, Eqs. (8.9) and (8.10) continue to hold for a nonplanar object in the
case where the CM is translating while the object is spinning around it (or more
precisely, spinning around an axis parallel to the z axis and passing through
the CM). The velocity V of the CM can actually point in any direction, and
these two equations are still valid. But we’ll assume in this chapter that all
velocities are in the x-y plane.

Lastly, the parallel-axis theorem still holds for a nonplanar object (the deriva-
tion using Eq. (8.9) is the same). But as mentioned in Section 8.1.4,
the
perpendicular-axis theorem does not hold. This is the one instance where we
need the planar assumption.

Finding the CM
The center of mass has come up repeatedly in this chapter. For example, when we
used the parallel-axis theorem, we needed to know where the CM was. In some
cases, such as with a stick or a disk, the location is obvious. But in other cases,
it isn’t so clear. So let’s get a little practice calculating the location of the CM.
Depending on whether the mass distribution is discrete or continuous, the position
of the CM is defined by (see Eq. (5.58))

RCM =

(cid:26)

rimi
M

,

or RCM =

(cid:17)

r dm
M

,

(8.21)

where M is the total mass. We’ll do an example with a continuous mass distribu-
tion here. As is often the case with problems involving an integral, the main step
in the solution is deciding how you want to slice up the object to do the integral.

Example (Hemispherical shell): Find the location of the CM of a hollow
hemispherical shell, with uniform mass density and radius R.

Solution: By symmetry, the CM is located on the line above the center of the base.
So our task reduces to finding the height, yCM. Let the mass density be σ . We’ll slice
the hemisphere up into horizontal rings, described by the angle θ above the horizontal,
as shown in Fig. 8.7. If the angular thickness of a ring is dθ, then its mass is

dm = σ dA = σ (length)(width) = σ (2πR cos θ)(R dθ).

(8.23)

The simple factor of 1/2 here is nice, but it’s not all that obvious. It comes from the
fact that each value of y is represented equally. If you solved the problem by doing a
dy integral instead of a dθ one, you would find that there is the same area (and hence
the same mass) in each ring of vertical height dy. In short, as y increases, the larger
tilt of the surface cancels out the smaller radius of the rings, yielding the same area.
You are encouraged to work this out.

The calculation of a CM is very similar to the calculation of a moment of
inertia. Both involve an integration over the mass of an object, but the former
has one power of a length in the integrand, whereas the latter has two powers.

8.3 Calculating moments of inertia

8.3.1 Lots of examples

Let’s now calculate the moments of inertia of various objects, around specified
axes. We’ll use ρ to denote the mass density (per unit length, area, or volume, as
appropriate), and we’ll assume that this density is uniform throughout the object.
For the more complicated objects in the list below, it is generally a good idea to
slice them up into pieces for which I is already known. The problem then reduces
to integrating over these known I ’s. There is usually more than one way to do this
slicing. For example, a sphere can be looked at as a series of concentric shells
or a collection of disks stacked on top of each other. In the examples below, you
may want to play around with slicings other than the ones given. Consider at least
a few of these examples to be problems and try to work them out for yourself.

1. A ring of mass M and radius R (axis through center, perpendicular to plane; Fig. 8.8):

where we have used sin2θ = (1 − cos 2θ )/2. You can also find I by using the
perpendicular-axis theorem. In the notation of Section 8.1.4, we have Ix = Iy, by
symmetry. Therefore, Iz = 2Ix. Using Iz = MR2 from Example 1 then gives Ix =
MR2/2.

3. A disk of mass M and radius R (axis through center, perpendicular to plane; Fig. 8.9):

You can save the (trivial) step of integrating over θ by considering the disk to be
made up of many concentric rings, and invoking Example 1. The mass of each ring is
(ρ2πr dr)r2 = πR4ρ/2 = MR2/2,
ρ2πr dr. Integrating over the rings gives I =
as above. Slicing up the disk is fairly inconsequential in this example, but it will save
you some trouble in others.

include them here for completeness.

An alternate and slick way of deriving this is to use the following result, similar in
spirit to the perpendicular-axis theorem: Adding up the three moments of inertia in
Eq. (8.19) gives

(cid:14)

Ix + Iy + Iz = 2

(x2 + y2 + z2) dm = 2

r2 dm.

(8.31)

If we apply this to a spherical shell, where r always equals the radius R, then the
right-hand side is 2MR2. And since the I ’s are all equal by symmetry, they must all
be 2MR2/3.

8. A solid sphere of mass M and radius R (any axis through center; Fig. 8.11): A sphere
is made up of concentric spherical shells. The volume of a shell is 4πr2dr. Using

The task of Exercise 8.33 is to derive this result by slicing the sphere into horizontal
disks.

9. An infinitesimally thin triangle of mass M and length L (axis through tip, perpendicular
to plane; Fig. 8.12): Let the base have length a, where a is infinitesimally small. Then
a tiny vertical slice a distance x from the tip has length a(x/L). If the slice has thickness
dx, then it is essentially a point mass of mass dm = ρax dx/L. Therefore,

because aL/2 is the area of the triangle. This has the same form as the disk in
Example 3, because a disk is made up of many of these triangles.

10. An isosceles triangle of mass M , vertex angle 2β, and common-side length L (axis
through tip, perpendicular to plane; Fig. 8.12): Let h be the altitude of the triangle
(so h = L cos β). Slice the triangle into thin strips parallel to the base. Let x be the
distance from a strip to the vertex. Then the length of a strip is (cid:2) = 2x tan β, and its
mass is dm = ρ(2x tan β dx). Using Example 5 above, along with the parallel-axis
theorem, we have

Ix = Mb2/12 and Iy = Ma2/12 (because the extent of an object along an axis doesn’t
affect the moment around that axis, when written in terms of the total M ). So the
perpendicular-axis theorem gives

Iz = Ix + Iy = 1

12 M (a2 + b2) .

(8.37)

8.3.2 A neat trick

For some objects with certain symmetries, it’s possible to calculate the moment
of inertia without doing any integrals. The only things we need are a scaling
argument and the parallel-axis theorem. We’ll illustrate this technique by finding
the I for a stick around its center (Example 5 above). You’ll find other applications
in the problems for this chapter.

(cid:17)

x2 dm =

In the present example, the basic trick is to compare the I for a stick of length L
with the I for a stick of length 2L (and same density ρ). A quick scaling argument
shows that the latter is eight times the former. This is true because the integral
(cid:17)
x2ρ dx has three powers of x in it (yes, the dx counts). So a change
of variables, x = 2y, brings in a factor of 23 = 8. Equivalently, if we imagine
expanding the smaller stick into the larger one, then a corresponding piece in the
larger stick will be twice as far from the axis, and also twice as massive. The
integral

x2 dm therefore increases by a factor of 22 · 2 = 8.

(cid:17)

The technique is most easily illustrated with pictures. If we denote the moment
of inertia of an object by a picture of the object, with a dot signifying the axis,

then we have:

The first line comes from the scaling argument, the second line comes from the
fact that moments of inertia simply add (the left-hand side is two copies of the
right-hand side, attached at the pivot), and the third line comes from the parallel-
axis theorem. Equating the right-hand sides of the first two equations gives

Plugging this expression for

into the third equation gives the desired

Note that sooner or later we must use real live numbers, which enter here through
the parallel-axis theorem. Using only scaling arguments isn’t sufficient, because
they provide only linear equations homogeneous in the I ’s, and therefore give
no means of picking up the proper dimensions. (For an interesting account of
Galileo’s discovery of scaling laws, see Peterson (2002).)

Once you’ve mastered this trick and applied it to the fractal objects in Prob-
lem 8.8, you can impress your friends by saying that you know how to “use
scaling arguments, along with the parallel-axis theorem, to calculate moments of
inertia of objects with fractal dimension.” And you never know when that might
come in handy!

8.4 Torque

We will now show that under certain conditions (stated below), the rate of change
of angular momentum is equal to a certain quantity, τ, which we call the torque.
That is, τ = dL/dt. This is the rotational analog of our old friend F = dp/dt
involving linear momentum. The basic idea here is straightforward, but there are
two subtle issues. One deals with internal forces within a collection of particles.
The other deals with the possible acceleration of the origin (the point relative to
which the torque and angular momentum are calculated). To keep things straight,
we’ll prove the general result by dealing with three increasingly complicated
situations.

8.4 Torque

323

Our derivation of τ = dL/dt here holds for completely general motion, so
we can take the result and use it in the following chapter, too. If you wish, you
can construct a more specific proof of τ = dL/dt for the special case where the
axis of rotation is parallel to the z axis. But since the general proof is no more
difficult, we’ll present it here in this chapter and do it once and for all.

8.4.1 Point mass, ﬁxed origin

Consider a point mass at position r relative to a fixed origin (see Fig. 8.14). The
time derivative of the angular momentum, L = r × p, is

where F is the force acting on the particle. This is the same calculation as in
Theorem 7.1, except that here we are considering an arbitrary force instead of a
central one. If we define the torque on the particle as

then Eq. (8.38) becomes

τ ≡ r × F,

τ = dL
dt

.

(8.39)

(8.40)

It is understood that the r in the torque is measured with respect to the same
origin as the r in the angular momentum.

8.4.2 Extended mass, ﬁxed origin

In an extended object, there are internal forces acting on the various pieces of the
object, in addition to whatever external forces exist. For example, the external
force on a given molecule in a body might come from gravity, while the internal
forces come from the adjacent molecules. How do we deal with these different
types of forces?

In what follows, we will deal only with internal forces that are central forces,
so that the force between two objects is directed along the line between them.
This is a valid assumption for the pushing and pulling forces between molecules
in a solid. (It isn’t valid, for example, when dealing with magnetic forces. But
we won’t be interested in such things here.) We will invoke Newton’s third law,

324

r1

r4

Fig. 8.15

Angular momentum, Part I (Constant ˆL)

which says that the force that particle 1 applies to particle 2 is equal and opposite
to the force that particle 2 applies to particle 1.

For concreteness, let’s assume that we have a collection of N discrete particles
labeled by the index i (see Fig. 8.15). In the continuous case, we would need to
replace the following sums with integrals. The total angular momentum of the
system is

The second-to-last line follows because vi × vi = 0, and also because

provide no net torque. This is quite reasonable. It basically says that a rigid object
with no external forces won’t spontaneously start rotating.

(cid:26)

Note that the right-hand side involves the total external torque acting on the
body, which may come from forces acting at many different points. Note also
that nowhere did we assume that the particles are rigidly connected to each other.
Equation (8.42) still holds even if there is relative motion among the particles.
But in that case, it’s usually hard to get a handle on L, because it doesn’t take the
nice I ω form.

8.4.3 Extended mass, nonﬁxed origin

Let the position of the origin be r0 (see Fig. 8.16), and let the positions of the
particles be ri. The vectors r0 and ri are measured with respect to a given fixed
coordinate system. The total angular momentum of the system, relative to the

The first term here is the external torque, measured relative to the origin r0. The
second term is something we wish would go away. And indeed, it usually does.
It vanishes if any of the following three conditions is satisfied.

1. R = r0, that is, the origin is the CM.
2. ¨r0 = 0, that is, the origin is not accelerating.
3. (R − r0) is parallel to ¨r0. This condition is rarely invoked.

If any of these conditions is satisfied, then we are free to write

(8.46)

In other words, we can equate the total external torque with the rate of change of
the total angular momentum. An immediate corollary of this result is:

Corollary 8.3 If the total external torque on a system is zero, then its angular
momentum is conserved. In particular, the angular momentum of an isolated
system (one that is subject to no external forces) is conserved.

7 More precisely, we are calculating the angular momentum relative to a coordinate system whose
origin is r0 and whose axes remain parallel to the fixed axes. If we allowed for a rotation of
the axes, then we would have to deal with all the fictitious-force issues that are the subject
of Chapter 10. As it is, we will still end up dealing with one fictitious force (see the remark
below).

326

Angular momentum, Part I (Constant ˆL)

Everything up to this point is valid for arbitrary motion. The particles can
be moving relative to each other, and the various Li’s can point in different
directions, etc. But let’s now restrict the motion. In the present chapter, we are
dealing only with cases where ˆL is constant (taken to point in the z direction).
Therefore, dL/dt = d(L ˆL)/dt = (dL/dt) ˆL. If in addition we consider only rigid
objects (where the relative distances among the particles are fixed) that undergo
pure rotation around a given point, then L = I ω, which gives dL/dt = I ˙ω ≡ I α.
Taking the magnitude of both sides of Eq. (8.46) then gives

τext = I α.

(8.47)

Invariably, we will calculate angular momentum and torque around either the
CM or a fixed point (or a point that moves with constant velocity, but this doesn’t
come up often). These are the “safe” origins, in the sense that Eq. (8.46) holds. As
long as you always use one of these safe origins, you can simply apply Eq. (8.46)
and not worry much about its derivation.

Remark: You’ll probably never end up invoking the third condition above, but it’s interesting
to note that there’s a simple way of understanding it in terms of accelerating reference frames.
This is the topic of Chapter 10, so we’re getting a little ahead of ourselves here, but the reasoning
is as follows. Let r0 be the origin of a reference frame that is accelerating with acceleration
¨r0. Then all objects in this accelerating frame feel a mysterious fictitious force of −m¨r0. For
example, on a train accelerating to the right with acceleration a, you feel a strange force of
ma pointing to the left. If you don’t counter this with another force (by grabbing a handle,
for example), then you will fall over. This fictitious force acts just like a gravitational force,
because it is proportional to the mass. Therefore, it effectively acts at the CM, producing a
torque of (R − r0) × (−M ¨r0). This is the second term in Eq. (8.45). This term vanishes if the
CM is directly “above” or “below” (as far as the fictitious gravitational force is concerned) the
origin, in other words, if (R − r0) is parallel to ¨r0. See Problem 10.8 for further discussion of
this in terms of fictitious forces.

There is one common situation where the third condition can be invoked. Consider a wheel
rolling without slipping on the ground. Mark a dot on the rim. At the instant this dot is in
contact with the ground, it is a valid choice for the origin. This is true because (R − r0) points
vertically. And ¨r0 also points vertically, because a dot on a rolling wheel traces out a cycloid.
Right before the dot hits the ground, it is moving straight downward. And right after it hits the
ground, it is moving straight upward. But having said this, there’s usually nothing to be gained
by picking such an origin. So the safe thing to do is to always pick your origin to be either the
CM or a fixed point, even if the third condition holds.

For conditions that number but three,
We say, “Torque is dL by dt.”
But though they’re all true,
I’ll stick to just two;
It’s CM’s and fixed points for me! ♣

Example: A string wraps around a uniform cylinder of mass M , which rests on a

and that the string is parallel to the plane. What is the acceleration of the mass m?

What is the condition on the ratio M /m for which the cylinder accelerates down the
plane?

First solution: The friction,
tension, and gravitational forces are shown in
Fig. 8.18. Define positive a1, a2, and α as shown. These three accelerations, along
with T and F, are five unknowns. We therefore need to produce five equations.
They are:

1. F = ma on m =⇒ T − mg = ma2.
2. F = ma on M =⇒ Mg sin θ − T − F = Ma1.
3. τ = I α on M (around the CM) =⇒ FR − TR = (MR2/2)α.
4. Nonslipping condition =⇒ α = a1/R.
5. Conservation of string =⇒ a2 = 2a1.

A few comments on these equations: The normal force and the gravitational force
perpendicular to the plane cancel, so we can ignore them. We have picked positive F
to point up the plane, but if it happens to point down the plane and thereby turn out
to be negative, that’s fine (but it won’t); we don’t need to worry about which way it
really points. In (3), we are using the CM of the cylinder as our origin, but we can
also use a fixed point; see the second solution below. In (5), we have used the fact that
the top of a rolling wheel moves twice as fast as the center. This is true because the
top has the same speed relative to the center as the center has relative to the ground.
We can go about solving these five equations in various ways. Three of the equations
involve only two variables, so it’s not so bad. (3) and (4) give F −T = Ma1/2. Adding
this to (2) gives Mg sin θ − 2T = 3Ma1/2. Using (1) to eliminate T , and using (5) to
write a1 in terms of a2, then gives

Mg sin θ − 2(mg + ma2) = 3Ma2
4

=⇒ a2 =

(M sin θ − 2m)g
(3/4)M + 2m

.

(8.48)

And a1 = a2/2. We see that a1 is positive (that is, the cylinder rolls down the plane)
if M /m > 2/ sin θ . If θ → 0, then this gives M /m → ∞, which makes sense.
If θ → π/2, then M /m → 2. The basic reason for this is that the friction force F, in
addition to the tension T , is holding the cylinder up (the coefficient of friction must
be very large in this case if no slipping is to occur).

In using τ = dL/dt, we can also pick a fixed point as our origin,
Second solution:
instead of the CM. The most sensible point is one that is located somewhere along
the plane. The Mg sin θ force now provides a torque, but the friction does not. And
the lever arm for the tension is now 2R. The angular momentum of the cylinder with
respect to a point on the plane is L = I ω + M v1R, where the second term comes from
the angular momentum due to the object being treated like a point mass at the CM.
So dL/dt = I α + Ma1R, and τ = dL/dt gives

(Mg sin θ )R − T (2R) = (MR2/2)α + Ma1R.

(8.49)

This turns out to be the sum of the third equation plus R times the second equation in
the first solution. We therefore obtain the same result.

Angular momentum, Part I (Constant ˆL)

8.5 Collisions

In Section 5.7, we looked at collisions involving point particles or otherwise
nonrotating objects. The fundamental ingredients there that enabled us to solve
problems were conservation of linear momentum and conservation of energy
(if the collision was elastic). With conservation of angular momentum now at
our disposal, we can extend our study of collisions to ones with rotating objects.
The additional fact of conservation of L is compensated for by the new degree of
freedom of the rotation. Therefore, provided that the problem is set up properly,
we will still have the same number of equations as unknowns.

Conservation of energy can be used in a collision only if it is elastic (by defini-
tion). But conservation of angular momentum is similar to conservation of linear
momentum, in that it can always be used (see the remark below), assuming that
the system is isolated. However, conservation of L is a little different from con-
servation of p, because we have to pick an origin before we can proceed. In view
of the three conditions that are necessary for Corollary 8.3 to hold, we must pick
our origin to be either a fixed point or the CM of the system (we’ll ignore the third
condition, since it’s rarely used). If we unwisely choose an accelerating point,
then τ = dL/dt does not hold, so we have no right to claim that dL/dt equals
zero just because the torque is zero (as it is for an isolated system). In collision
problems, it is easy to fall into the trap of picking an accelerating point as your
origin. For example, you might choose the center of a stick as your origin. But if
another object collides with the stick, then the center will accelerate, making it
an invalid choice for the origin.

Remark: As far as conservation goes, the way that E differs from p and L is that energy
can be hidden in the microscopic motion of molecules in the body, in the form of heat. This
motion consists of little vibrations with small amplitudes but high speeds. The energy of these
vibrations can be large enough to be on the same order of magnitude as the overall energy
of the system. But because the vibrations are too small to see, it appears that energy is lost.
However, note that even though they’re too small to see, you can still feel them with your hand,
as heat.

Linear momentum, however, can’t be hidden. If an object (not necessarily rigid) has nonzero
momentum, then it has to be moving as a whole, and there’s no way around that. In short, since
P = MVCM, we see that if P is nonzero, then VCM is also. So the motion must be on a
macroscopic scale; there’s no way for it to be hidden on a microscopic scale.

With angular momentum, things are a little trickier. If the object is rigid, then it can’t
have hidden angular momentum, for reasons similar to those in the linear momentum case;
since L = I ω, we see that if L is nonzero, then ω is also. However, if the object isn’t
rigid (consider, say, a gas of particles), then it turns out that it can theoretically have hid-
den angular momentum in microscopic motion, although in practice it ends up being too small
to notice. This hidden angular momentum can arise from little swirling regions throughout
the system. In contrast with linear momentum, it is possible to have angular momentum with-
out any overall motion. So in this respect, this microscopic swirling motion is similar to the
microscopic vibrational motion that yields hidden energy. There are, however, three main
differences.

First, if we’re assuming that the swirling motion takes place on a microscopic scale, then the
r in L = mrv is very small, and this leads to a negligible L. This argument doesn’t hold for E,
because the energy of the vibrations doesn’t involve r. Instead, it involves only v, in the form of

8.5 Collisions

329

mv2/2, so it can end up being large. Second, there’s no easy way to start up the circular motion
of many little swirls by means of a collision, in contrast with the easily started random linear
motion that makes up the energy of heat; you just smash two things together. And third, in the
case where the object is rigid, the molecules can easily vibrate, but they can’t rotate indefinitely
because this would involve ripping apart the bonds between adjacent molecules. The issue is
that in vibrational motion all coordinates remain small, whereas in rotational motion they don’t,
because θ eventually becomes large.

There is, however, one very common phenomenon, namely magnetism, that (in a sense) is
an exception to all three of the above points. Although magnetism isn’t an angular momentum,
it does come (roughly speaking) from the “circular” motion of electrons around the nuclei in
atoms. (In general, it actually comes more from the “spin” of the electrons than their orbital
motion around the nuclei, but let’s not worry about that here. To get everything right, we’d
have to think in terms of quantum mechanics, anyway. Let’s just work in a rough classical
approximation.) Electrons throughout a magnetic material move in tiny little correlated loops.
We can escape the above three points of reasoning because first, the magnetic field involves the
electric charge e, and this is large enough (on the scale of things) to cancel out the smallness of
the r factor. (The actual angular momentum of the electrons in a magnetic material is negligible
because their mass is so small. There isn’t a large quantity like e to save the day.) Second, it
is quite easy to get the electrons moving in correlated circles by means of magnetic forces;
there’s no need to smash things together. And third, the electrons are free to move around in
little circles (in a classical sense) in atoms without ripping things apart. ♣

It is important to remember that you are free to choose your origin from the
legal possibilities of fixed points or the CM. Since it is generally the case that one
choice is better than others (in that it makes the calculations easier), you should
take advantage of this freedom. Let’s do two examples. First an elastic collision,
and then an inelastic one.

Example (Elastic collision): A mass m travels perpendicular to a stick of mass
m and length (cid:2), which is initially at rest. At what location should the mass collide
elastically with the stick, so that the mass and the center of the stick move with equal
speeds after the collision?

Solution: Let the initial speed of the mass be v0. We have three unknowns in the
problem (see Fig. 8.19), namely the desired distance from the middle of the stick,
h; the final (equal) speeds of the stick and the mass, v; and the final angular speed
of the stick, ω. We can solve for these three unknowns by using our three available
conservation laws:

from the origin, so there is no contribution to L from the first of the two parts in

(8.53)

You are encouraged to solve this problem again with a different choice of origin,
for example, the fixed point that coincides with the spot where the mass hits the
stick, or the CM of the entire system.

Remark: After the stick makes half of a revolution, it will hit the backside of m. The
resulting motion will have the stick sitting at rest (both translationally and rotationally)
and the mass moving with its initial speed v0. You can show this by working though the
second collision, using the quantities we found above. Or you can just use the fact that this
scenario certainly satisfies conservation of p, E, and L with the initial conditions, so it must
be what happens (because the quadratic conservation statements have only two solutions,
and the other one corresponds to the intermediate motion). Note that the time it takes the
stick to make half of a revolution is π/ω = π(cid:2)/
6v0. So the stick travels a distance of
(v0/2)(π(cid:2)/
6) before it ends up at rest. This distance is independent of
v0 (which follows from dimensional analysis). ♣

Let’s now look at an inelastic collision, where one object sticks to another. We
won’t be able to use conservation of E now. But conservation of p and L will be
sufficient since there is one fewer degree of freedom in the final motion, because
the objects don’t move independently.

Example (Inelastic collision): A mass m travels at speed v0 perpendicular to a
stick of mass m and length (cid:2), which is initially at rest. The mass collides completely
inelastically with the stick at one of its ends and sticks to it. What is the resulting
angular velocity of the system?

Solution: The first thing to note is that the CM of the system is (cid:2)/4 from the end,
as shown in Fig. 8.20. After the collision, the system rotates about the CM as the CM
moves in a straight line. Conservation of momentum quickly tells us that the speed
of the CM is v0/2. Also, using the parallel-axis theorem, the moment of inertia of the
system around the CM is

There are now many ways to proceed, depending on what point we choose as our
origin.

First method: Choose the origin to be the fixed point that coincides with the location
of the CM right when the collision happens (that is, the point (cid:2)/4 from the end of the
stick). Conservation of L says that the initial L of the ball must equal the final L of
the system. This gives

(8.55)

The zero here comes from the fact that the CM of the stick moves directly away from
the origin, so there is no contribution to L from the first of the two parts in Theorem
8.1. Note that we didn’t need to use conservation of p in this method.

Second method: Choose the origin to be the fixed point that coincides with the
initial center of the stick. Then conservation of L gives

(8.56)

The right-hand side is the angular momentum of the system relative to the CM, plus
the angular momentum (relative to the origin) of a point mass of mass 2m located
at the CM.

Third method: Choose the origin to be the CM of the system. This point moves to
the right with speed v0/2, along the line a distance (cid:2)/4 below the top of the stick.
Relative to the CM, the mass m moves to the right, and the stick moves to the left,
both with speed v0/2. Conservation of L gives

(8.57)

The zero here comes from the fact that the stick initially has no L around its center.
A fourth reasonable choice for the origin is the fixed point that coincides with the
initial location of the top of the stick. You can work this one out for practice.

8.6 Angular impulse
In Section 5.5.1, we defined the impulse, which we’ll label as I, to be the time
integral of the force applied to an object. From Newton’s second law, F = dp/dt,
the impulse is therefore the net change in linear momentum. That is,
(cid:14)

t2

I ≡

F(t) dt = (cid:16)p.

(8.58)

t1

We now define the angular impulse, Iθ , to be the time integral of the torque
applied to an object. From τ = dL/dt, the angular impulse is therefore the net

332

Angular momentum, Part I (Constant ˆL)

change in angular momentum. That is,

Iθ ≡

(cid:14)

t2

t1

τ(t) dt = (cid:16)L.

(8.59)

These are just definitions, devoid of any content. The place where the physics
comes in is the following. Consider a situation where F(t) is always applied
at the same position relative to the origin around which τ(t) is calculated (this
origin must be a legal one, of course). Let this position be R. Then we have
τ(t) = R × F(t). Plugging this into Eq. (8.59), and taking the constant R outside
the integral, gives Iθ = R × I. In other words,

(cid:16)L = R × ((cid:16)p)

(cid:5)

for F(t) applied at one position

(cid:6)

.

(8.60)

This is a very useful result. It gives the relation between the net changes in L
and p, as opposed to the individual values of each. Even if F(t) is changing in
some arbitrary manner as time goes by, so that we have no idea what (cid:16)L and
(cid:16)p themselves are, we still know that they are related by Eq. (8.60). In many
cases, we don’t have to worry about the cross product in Eq. (8.60), because the
lever arm R is perpendicular to the change in momentum (cid:16)p. In such cases,
we have

|(cid:16)L| = R|(cid:16)p|.

(8.61)

Also, in many cases the object starts at rest, so we don’t have to bother with
the (cid:16)’s. The following example is a classic application of angular impulse
and Eq. (8.61).

Example (Striking a stick): A stick of mass m and length (cid:2), initially at rest, is
struck with a hammer. The blow is made perpendicular to the stick at one end. Let
the blow occur quickly, so that the stick doesn’t have time to move much while the
hammer is in contact. If the CM of the stick ends up moving at speed v, what are the
velocities of the ends right after the blow?

Solution: Although we have no hope of knowing exactly what F(t) looks like, or
the length of time it is applied, we still know from Eq. (8.61) that (cid:16)L = ((cid:2)/2)(cid:16)p,
where we have chosen our origin to be the CM, which gives a lever arm of
(cid:2)/2. Therefore, (m(cid:2)2/12)ω = ((cid:2)/2)mv, so the final v and ω are related by
ω = 6v/(cid:2).

The velocities of the ends right after the blow are obtained by adding (or subtracting)
the rotational motion to the CM’s translational motion. The rotational velocities of the
ends relative to the CM are ±ω((cid:2)/2) = ±(6v/(cid:2))((cid:2)/2) = ±3v. Therefore, the end
that is hit moves with velocity v + 3v = 4v, and the other end moves with velocity
v − 3v = −2v (that is, backward).

There is friction between the ball and the sphere. The ball is given an

the ball lose contact with the sphere? How does your answer change
if the size of the ball is comparable to, or larger than, the size of the

done so.

A ladder of length (cid:2) and uniform mass density stands on a frictionless

A tube of mass M and length (cid:2) is free to swing around a pivot at one end.
A mass m is positioned inside the (frictionless) tube at this end. The tube
is held horizontal and then released (see Fig. 8.24). Let θ be the angle
of the tube with respect to the horizontal, and let x be the distance the
mass has traveled along the tube. Find the Euler–Lagrange equations for
θ and x, and then write them in terms of θ and η ≡ x/(cid:2) (the fraction of
the distance along the tube).

These equations can only be solved numerically, and you must pick
a numerical value for the ratio r ≡ m/M in order to do this. Write a
program (see Section 1.4) that produces the value of η when the tube is
vertical (θ = π/2). Give this value of η for a few values of r.

the middle third from each of the remaining two pieces. Then
remove the middle third from each of the remaining four pieces,
and so on, forever. Let the final object have mass m, and let the axis
be through the center, perpendicular to the stick; see Fig. 8.27.8

8 This object is the Cantor set, for those who like such things. It has no length, so the density of
the remaining mass is infinite. If you suddenly develop an aversion to point masses with infinite

a chimney. Assume that the chimney consists of boards stacked on top
of each other, and that each board is attached to the two adjacent ones
with tiny rods at each end (see Fig. 8.35). The goal is to determine
which rod in the chimney achieves the maximum tension. Work in the

A ball with radius R and I = (2/5)mR2 is thrown through the air. It
spins around the axis perpendicular to the (vertical) plane of the motion.
Call this the x-y plane. The ball bounces off a floor without slipping
during the time of contact. Assume that the collision is elastic, and that
the magnitude of the vertical vy is the same before and after the bounce.

8.22. Rolling over a bump **

A ball with radius R and moment of inertia I = (2/5)mR2 rolls with

8.23. Falling toast **

After buttering your toast (assumed to be a uniform rigid square of
side length (cid:2), for the sake of having a doable problem) one morning and
holding it in a horizontal position with buttered side up, you accidentally
drop it from a height H above a counter, which itself is a height h above
the ground. The toast is oriented “parallel” to the counter, and as it falls,
one edge barely clips the counter (elastically), causing the toast to spin.
What value of H , in terms of h and (cid:2), yields the unfortunate scenario
where the toast makes half of a revolution, landing buttered side down
on the floor? There is a special value of (cid:2) in terms of h. What is it, and
why is it special?

V0

8.24. Sliding to rolling **

Aball initially slides without rotating on a horizontal surface with friction
(see Fig. 8.37). The initial speed is V0, and the moment of inertia around
the center is I = βmR2.

(a) Without knowing anything about the nature of the friction force,
find the speed of the ball when it begins to roll without slipping.
Also, find the kinetic energy lost while sliding.

(b) Now consider the special case where the coefficient of kinetic
friction is µ, independent of position. At what time, and at what
distance, does the ball begin to roll without slipping? Verify that
the work done by friction equals the energy loss calculated in part
(a). (Be careful on this.)

8.25. Lots of sticks ***

Consider a collection of rigid sticks of length 2r, masses mi, and
moments of inertia βmir2, with m1 (cid:6) m2 (cid:6) m3 (cid:6) · · · . The CM
of each stick is located at its center. The sticks are placed on a horizon-
tal frictionless surface, as shown in Fig. 8.38. The ends overlap a tiny
distance in the y direction and are a tiny distance apart in the x direc-
tion. The first (heaviest) stick is given an instantaneous blow (as shown)
which causes it to translate and rotate. The first stick will strike the
second stick, which will then strike the third stick, and so on. Assume
that all the collisions are elastic. Depending on the size of β, the speed
of the nth stick will either (1) approach zero, (2) approach infinity, or

8.26. Swinging stick **

L

A uniform stick of length L is pivoted at its bottom end and is initially
held vertical. It is given an infinitesimal kick, and it swings down around
the pivot. After three-quarters of a turn (in the horizontal position shown
in Fig. 8.39), the pivot is somehow vaporized, and the stick flies freely
up in the air. What is the maximum height of the center of the stick in
the resulting motion? At what angle is the stick tilted when the center
reaches this maximum height?

8.27. Atwood’s with a cylinder **

A massless string of negligible thickness is wrapped around a uniform
cylinder of mass m and radius r. The string passes up over a massless
pulley and is tied to a block of mass m at its other end, as shown in
Fig. 8.40. The system is released from rest. What are the accelerations
of the block and the cylinder? Assume that the string does not slip with
respect to the cylinder. Use conservation of energy (after applying a
quick F = ma argument to show that the two objects move downward
with the same acceleration).

8.28. Board and cylinders **

A board lies on top of two uniform cylinders that lie on a fixed plane
inclined at an angle θ, as shown in Fig. 8.41. The board has mass m, and
each of the cylinders has mass m/2. The system is released from rest. If
there is no slipping between any of the surfaces, what is the acceleration
of the board? Use conservation of energy.

8.29. Moving plane ***

A ball of mass m and moment of inertia I = βmr2 is held motionless on a
plane of mass M and angle of inclination θ (see Fig. 8.42). The plane rests
on a frictionless horizontal surface. The ball is released. Assuming that
it rolls without slipping on the plane, what is the horizontal acceleration
of the plane? Hint: You might want to do Problem 3.8 first. But as
with all the exercises in this section, use conservation of energy instead
of force and torque; this problem gets extremely messy with the latter
strategy.

acceleration of the spool? Which way does it move?

8.48. Stopping the coin **

A coin stands vertically on a table. It is projected forward (in the plane
of itself) with speed v and angular speed ω, as shown in Fig. 8.49. The

and rotationally) a distance d from where it started?

8.49. Measuring g **

(a) Consider an extended pendulum whose CM is a distance (cid:2) from
the pivot, and whose moment of inertia around the pivot is I . Show
that the frequency of small oscillations is ω =
mg(cid:2)/I , which
√
gives T = 2π/ω = 2π
I /mg(cid:2), and hence g = 4π 2I /(m(cid:2)T 2).
Therefore, by measuring I , m, (cid:2), and T , you can determine g.
However, if the pendulum has an odd shape, it may be difficult
to determine I . Consider, then, the following alternative method
of measuring g.

√

(b) For simplicity, assume that the pendulum is planar. Pick an arbi-
trary point as the pivot and measure the period, T , of small
oscillations. Then with the pendulum at rest, draw a vertical line
through this pivot. By trial and error, find another pivot point
on this line on the same side of the CM 9 (you may need to
extend the line with a massless extension) that yields the same
period T . Let L be the sum of the lengths from these two points
to the CM.10 Show that g is given by g = 4π 2L/T 2, which is
independent of m and I .

8.50. Pulling a cylinder **

Asolid cylinder of mass m and radius r lies flat on a frictionless horizontal
table, with a massless string running halfway around it, as shown in

9 The CM can be found by hanging the pendulum from a point not on the drawn line, and then

drawing a vertical line through this point. The intersection of the two lines is the CM.

10 There are also two points on the other side of the CM that yield the same period (except in the
special case where the two points coincide and produce the minimum period, as in Exercise 8.43,
but don’t worry about this). These two other points are the same distances from the CM as the
original two points, as you can show. So if you happen to find all four points, you can obtain L by
instead measuring the distance from the “inside” point on one side to the “outside” point on the
other. This method doesn’t require knowing the location of the CM.

string?

8.51. Coin and plank **

A coin of mass M and radius R stands vertically on the right end of
a horizontal plank of mass M and length L, as shown in Fig. 8.51.
The system starts at rest. The plank is then pulled to the right with a
constant force F. Assume that the coin does not slip with respect to
the plank. What are the accelerations of the plank and coin? How far
to the right does the coin move by the time the left end of the plank
reaches it?

8.52. Cylinder, board, and spring **

A board of mass m, which is free to slide on a frictionless floor, is
connected by a spring (with spring constant k) to a wall. A cylinder,
also of mass m (and I = mR2/2), rests on top of the board, as shown in
Fig. 8.52, and is free to roll without slipping on the board. If the board
and the cylinder are pulled some distance to the left and then released
from rest, what is the frequency of the resulting oscillatory motion?

8.53. Swirling around a cone **

Fig. 8.52

A fixed hollow frictionless cone is positioned with its tip pointing down.
A particle is released from rest on the inside surface. After it has slid
halfway down to the tip, it bounces elastically off a platform. The plat-
form is positioned at a 45◦ angle along the surface of the cone, so the
particle ends up being deflected horizontally along the surface (in other
words, into the page in Fig. 8.53). The particle then swirls up and
around the cone before coming down. Measured from the tip of the
cone, show that the ratio of the particle’s maximum swirling height to
the height of the platform is (
5 + 1)/2, which just happens to be the
golden ratio.

8.54. Raising a hoop **

A bead of mass m is positioned at the top of a frictionless hoop of mass
M and radius R, which stands vertically on the ground. A wall touches
the hoop on its left, and a short wall of height R touches the hoop on
its right, as shown in Fig. 8.54. All surfaces are frictionless. The bead
is given a tiny kick, and it slides down the hoop, as shown. What is the
largest value of m/M for which the hoop never rises up off the ground?
Note: It’s possible to solve this problem by using only force, but solve
it here by using torque.

8.55. Block and cylinder **

A block and a cylinder (with I = βmR2), both of mass m, lie on a plane
(inclined at an angle θ), touching each other as shown in Fig. 8.55.
There is sufficient friction between the cylinder and the plane so that
it rolls without slipping. But the bottom of the block is coated with
grease, so there is no friction between it and the plane. However, there
is a coefficient of kinetic friction µ = 1 between the block’s right face
and the cylinder. What is the acceleration of the block? How does your
answer compare with the result for a lone cylinder rolling down a plane?
Assume that θ is small enough so that the block’s bottom face remains in
contact with the plane at all times; what is the condition on θ for which
this is true?

8.56. Falling and sliding stick ***

One end of a uniform stick is attached to a pivot, and the pivot is free
to slide along a frictionless horizontal rail. The stick is held at an initial
angle θ0 with respect to the (upward) vertical direction and then released;
see Fig. 8.56. Assume that the stick can somehow swing down below
the horizontal position without running into the rail (perhaps by having
the pivot attached to the side of the rail, so that the stick is shifted
horizontally a small distance from the rail).

(a) Show that when the stick is horizontal, the normal force N from

the rail equals mg/4, independent of θ0.

(b) If θ0 = 0 (a tiny kick is allowed), show that N = 13mg when the

stick is at the bottom of its motion (at θ = π).

(c) If θ0 = 0, show that the minimum N occurs at θ ≈ 61.5◦ and that
the value is Nmin ≈ (0.165)mg. You will obtain a cubic; feel free
to solve it numerically.

8.57. Tower of cylinders ****

Consider the infinitely tall system of massless planks and identical mas-
sive cylinders shown in Fig. 8.57. The moment of inertia of the cylinders
is I = MR2/2. There are two cylinders at each level, and the number of
levels is infinite. The cylinders do not slip with respect to the planks,
but the bottom plank is free to slide on a table. If you pull on the bottom
plank so that it accelerates horizontally with acceleration a, what is the
horizontal acceleration of the bottom row of cylinders?

8.59. No final rotation *

A stick of mass m and length (cid:2) spins around on a frictionless horizontal
table, with its CM at rest (but not fixed by a pivot). A ball of mass M is
placed on the table, and one end of the stick collides elastically with it,
as shown in Fig. 8.59. What should M be so that after the collision the
stick has translational motion, but no rotational motion?

8.60. Same final speeds *

A stick slides perpendicular to itself (without rotating) across a friction-
less horizontal table and collides elastically at one of its ends with a
stationary ball. Both the stick and the ball have mass m. The mass of the
stick is distributed in such a way that the moment of inertia around the
CM (which is at the center of the stick) is I = Am(cid:2)2, where A is some
number. What should A be so that the ball moves at the same speed as
the center of the stick after the collision?

A mass M moves at speed V0 perpendicular to a dumbbell at rest on
a frictionless horizontal table, as shown in Fig. 8.60. The dumbbell
consists of two masses m at the ends of a massless rod of length (cid:2).
The mass M collides elastically with one of the masses (not head-on),
and afterwards it is observed that M moves perpendicular to its original
direction, with speed u. What is u in terms of V0, m, and M ? What is the
smallest value of m (in terms of M ) for which this scenario is possible?

8.62. Glancing off a stick **

A frictionless stick of mass m and length (cid:2) lies at rest on a frictionless
horizontal table. A mass km (where k is some number) moves with speed
v0 at a 45◦ angle to the stick and collides elastically with it very close
to an end; see Fig. 8.61. What should k be so that the mass ends up
moving in the y-direction, as shown? Hint: Remember that the stick is
frictionless.

8.63. Sticking to a dumbbell *

A mass m moves at speed v perpendicular to a dumbbell at rest on
a frictionless horizontal table, as shown in Fig. 8.62. The dumbbell

8.64. Colliding sticks **

On a frictionless horizontal table, a stick of mass m and length (cid:2) spins
around a pivot at one of its ends with angular frequency ω. It collides and
sticks to an identical stick, with an overlap length equal to x, as shown
in Fig. 8.63. Immediately before the collision, the pivot is removed.
What should x be so that after the collision the double-stick system has
translational but no rotational motion?

8.65. Lollipop **

A hockey puck of mass m and radius R slides across frictionless ice, as
shown in Fig. 8.64 (the view is from above). It has translational speed
v to the right and rotational speed ω clockwise. It grazes the “top” end
of a rod of mass m and length 2R which is initially at rest on the ice.
It sticks to the rod, forming a rigid object that looks like a lollipop.

(a) In the special case of v = Rω, what is the resulting angular speed

of the lollipop?

(b) How much energy is lost during the collision? How do you explain
the fact that energy is lost, given that the v = Rω condition implies
that the contact point on the puck touches the rod with zero relative
speed (and thus doesn’t crash into it, as is commonly the case with
inelastic collisions)?

(c) Given ω, show that v should equal 6Rω/5 if you want the

minimum amount of energy to be lost.

8.66. Pencil on a plane ****

This exercise deals with the terminal velocity of a “pencil” rolling down
a plane. To simplify things, we’ll assume that the pencil has all its mass
on its axis. And to avoid messy complications, we’ll assume that the
cross section of the pencil looks like a wheel with six equally spaced
massless spokes and no rim (see Fig. 8.65).11 Let the length of the spokes
be r, and let the plane be inclined at an angle θ. Assume that there is
sufficient friction to prevent the spokes from slipping on the plane, and
assume that the pencil does not bounce when a spoke hits the plane.

(a) Explain qualitatively why the pencil reaches a terminal (average)
velocity, assuming that it remains in contact with the plane at all
times.

11 If the pencil instead looks like a hexagon with flat sides, then it is impossible to say how it
behaves, because if the sides bow outward an infinitesimal amount then the system conserves
energy, whereas if they bow inward an infinitesimal amount then it does not (for reasons you will
figure out).

(b) Assume that conditions have been set up so that the pencil
eventually reaches a nonzero terminal (average) velocity, while
remaining in contact with the plane at all times. Describe this
terminal velocity. You may do this by stating the maximum speed
of the axis in the limiting steady state.

(c) What is the minimum value of θ for which a nonzero terminal

velocity exists? An initial kick to the pencil is allowed.

(d) What is the maximum value of θ for which the pencil remains in
contact with the plane at all times? As a check on your answer,
the difference between the answers in parts (c) and (d) is about
5.09◦.

At what height should you horizontally strike a pool ball so that it
immediately rolls without slipping?

8.68. Center of percussion *

You hold one end of a uniform stick of length L. The stick is struck
with a hammer. Where should this blow occur so that the end you are
holding doesn’t move (immediately after the blow)? In other words,
where should the blow occur so that you don’t feel a “sting” in your
hand? This point is called the center of percussion.

8.69. Another center of percussion *

You hold the top vertex of a solid equilateral triangle of side length L. The
plane of the triangle is vertical. It is struck with a hammer, somewhere
along the vertical axis. Where should this blow occur so that the point
you are holding doesn’t move (immediately after the blow)? Use the
fact that the moment of inertia about any axis through the CM of an
equilateral triangle is mL2/24.

8.70. Not hitting the pole **

A (possibly non-uniform) stick of mass m and length (cid:2) lies on frictionless
ice. Its midpoint (which is also its CM) touches a thin pole sticking out
of the ice. One end of the stick is struck with a quick blow perpendicular
to the stick, as shown in Fig. 8.66, so that the CM moves away from the
pole. What is the minimum value of the stick’s moment of inertia that
allows the stick not to hit the pole?

paper in an arbitrary (straight line) manner, frontward or backward. You
may even give it abrupt, jerky motions, so that the ball slips with respect
to it. After the ball comes off the paper, it will eventually roll without
slipping on the table. Show (and you are encouraged to experimentally
verify this) that the ball in fact ends up at rest. (The generalization of
this fact is given in Problem 9.29.) Is it possible to pull the paper in such
a way that the ball ends up exactly where it started?

8.72. Up, down, and twisting **

A uniform stick is held horizontally and then released. At the same
instant, one end is struck with a quick upwards blow. If the stick ends
up horizontal when it returns to its original height, what are the possible
values for the maximum height to which the center rises?

8.73. Doing work **

(a) A pencil of mass m and length (cid:2) lies at rest on a frictionless table.
You push on it at its midpoint (perpendicular to it), with a constant
force F for a time t. Find the final speed and the distance traveled.
Verify that the work you do equals the final kinetic energy.
(b) Assume that you apply the same force F for the same time t
as above, but that you now apply it at one of the pencil’s ends
(perpendicular to the pencil). Assume that t is small, so that the
pencil doesn’t have much time to rotate (this means that you can
assume that your force is always essentially perpendicular to the
pencil, as far as the torque is concerned). Find the final CM speed,
the final angular speed, and the distance your hand moves. Verify
that the work you do equals the final kinetic energy.

8.74. Bouncing between bricks ***

A stick of length (cid:2) slides on frictionless ice. It bounces elastically
between two parallel fixed bricks, a distance L apart, in such a way
that the same end touches both bricks, and the stick hits the bricks at

What should θ be in terms of L and (cid:2) (again, an implicit equation

8.76. Bouncing under a table **

You throw a superball so that it bounces off the floor, then off the under-
side of a table, then off the floor again. What must the initial relation
between vx and Rω be so that the ball returns to your hand, with the
outward and return paths the same? Use the result of Problem 8.20, and
modifications thereof.12

8.77. Bouncing under a table again ****

Consider the setup in the previous exercise, where we assumed that the
outward and return paths were the same. Is this trajectory (where the
path retraces itself ) the only possible one for which the ball returns to
your hand? Show13 that the answer is “yes” unless t1 = 7t2, where t1
is the time the ball spends between your hand and the floor (which is
the same out and back, because the magnitude of vy isn’t changed by
a bounce), and t2 is the time the ball spends between the floor and the
table (again, the same out and back). For the special case where t1 = 7t2,
you will find that the ball returns to your hand for any initial relation
between vx and Rω. 14

For a ball with a general moment of inertia I = βmr2, show that
the answer is always “yes,” without exception, if β ≤ 1/3 (which
corresponds to a wheel with massive spokes and a massless rim). Also,
show that if β = 1 (a hoop), then the t1 = 7t2 condition becomes t1 = t2.
In other words, if you throw a “super-hoop” from the same height as
the table, then no matter how you throw it (as long as the throw is
downward and in the plane of the hoop), it will return to your hand. This
is a little more believable if you look at the remark in the solution to
Problem 8.20.

The two masses have equal speeds at all times. Let v be their common speed after they
have each moved a distance d. If 2m falls a distance d (so that m rises a distance d),

12 You are strongly encouraged to bounce a ball in such a manner and have it magically come back
to your hand. It turns out that the required value of ω is small, so a natural throw with ω ≈ 0
essentially gets the job done.

13 You will want to use Mathematica or some other aid to keep track of the matrix multiplications,
especially in the second part of this exercise, which would be completely intractable otherwise.

8.2. Leaving the sphere

In this setup, as in Problem 5.3, the ball leaves the sphere when the normal force
becomes zero, that is, when

mv2
R

= mg cos θ .

(8.66)

The only change from the solution to Problem 5.3 comes in the calculation of v. The
ball now has rotational energy, so conservation of energy gives mgR(1 − cos θ ) =
mv2/2 + I ω2/2 = mv2/2 + βmr2ω2/2. But the nonslipping condition is v = rω, so
we have

(cid:13)

(1 + β)mv2 = mgR(1 − cos θ ) =⇒ v =

1
2

2gR(1 − cos θ )
1 + β

.

Plugging this into Eq. (8.66), we see that the ball leaves the sphere when

cos θ = 2

3 + β .

(8.67)

(8.68)

Remarks: For β = 0, this equals 2/3, as in Problem 5.3. For a uniform ball with
β = 2/5, we have cos θ = 10/17, so θ ≈ 54◦. For β → ∞ (for example, a spool with
a very thin axle rolling down the rim of a circle), we have cos θ → 0, so θ ≈ 90◦.
This makes sense because v is always very small, since most of the energy takes the
form of rotational energy. The coefficient of friction would have to be very large in
this case, of course, to keep the spool from slipping near θ ≈ 90◦. ♣

If the size of the ball is comparable to, or larger than, the size of the sphere, then we
must take into account the fact that the CM of the ball does not move along a circle of
radius R. Instead, it moves along a circle of radius R + r, so Eq. (8.66) becomes

mv2
R + r

= mg cos θ .

(8.69)

Also, the conservation of energy equation takes the form, mg(R + r)(1 − cos θ ) =
mv2/2 + βmr2ω2/2. But v still equals rω (because the ball can be considered to be
instantaneously rotating around the contact point with angular speed ω), so the kinetic
energy still equals (1 + β)mv2/2. The conservation of energy statement is thus

(1 + β)mv2 = mg(R + r)(1 − cos θ ).

(8.70)

2

We therefore have the same equations as above, except that R is replaced everywhere by
R + r. But R didn’t appear in the result for θ in Eq. (8.68), so the answer is unchanged.

Remark: The method of the second solution to Problem 5.3 does not work in this
problem, because there is a force available to make vx decrease, namely the friction

8.9 Solutions

351

force. And indeed, vx does decrease before the rolling ball leaves the sphere. At a given
1 + β times the v in Problem
value of θ , the v in the present problem is simply 1/
5.3, so the maximum vx is achieved here at cos θ = 2/3, just as in Problem 5.3. But
the angle in Eq. (8.68) is larger than this, so vx decreases while the ball is between
these two angles. (However, see the following problem for a setup involving rotations
where the max vx is relevant.) ♣

√

8.3. Sliding ladder

The important point to realize in this problem is that the ladder loses contact with the
wall before it hits the ground. So we need to find where this loss of contact occurs. Let
r = (cid:2)/2, for convenience. While the ladder is in contact with the wall, its CM moves
in a circle of radius r. This follows from the fact that the median to the hypotenuse of
a right triangle has half the length of the hypotenuse. Let θ be the angle between the
wall and the radius from the corner to the CM (see Fig. 8.68). This is also the angle
between the ladder and the wall.

We’ll solve this problem by assuming that the CM always moves in a circle, and
then determining the position at which the horizontal CM speed starts to decrease, that
is, the point at which the normal force from the wall would have to become negative.
Since the normal force of course can’t be negative, this is the point where the ladder
loses contact with the wall.

By conservation of energy, the kinetic energy of the ladder equals the loss in potential
energy, which is mgr(1 − cos θ). This kinetic energy can be broken up into the CM
translational energy plus the rotation energy. The CM translational energy is mr2 ˙θ 2/2,
because the CM travels in a circle of radius r. The rotational energy is I ˙θ 2/2. The
same ˙θ applies here as in the CM translational motion, because θ is the angle between
the ladder and the vertical, and is thus the angle of rotation of the ladder. Letting
I ≡ βmr2 to be general (β = 1/3 for our ladder), the conservation of energy statement
is (1+β)mr2 ˙θ 2/2 = mgr(1−cos θ). Therefore, the speed of the CM, which is v = r ˙θ ,
equals

Note that this is 1/3 of the

were arranged (perhaps by having the top end slide down a curve) to eventually slide
horizontally along the ground. You are encouraged to compare various aspects of this
problem with those in Problem 8.2 and Problem 5.3.

Remark: The normal force from the wall is zero at the start and zero at the finish, so
it must reach a maximum at some intermediate value of θ . Let’s find this θ . Taking the

8.4. Leaning rectangle

We must first find the position of the rectangle’s CM when it has rotated through an
angle θ. Using Fig. 8.69, we can obtain this position (relative to the center of the
cylinder) by adding up the distances along the three shaded triangles. Because there
is no slipping, the contact point has moved a distance Rθ along the rectangle. We find
that the position of the CM is

(x, y) = R(sin θ , cos θ ) + Rθ (− cos θ , sin θ ) + a(sin θ , cos θ ).

(8.76)

We’ll now use the Lagrangian method to find the equation of motion and the frequency
of small oscillations. Using Eq. (8.76), you can show that the square of the speed of
the CM is

v2 = ˙x2 + ˙y2 = (a2 + R2θ 2) ˙θ 2.

(8.77)

The simplicity of this result suggests that there is a quicker way to obtain it. And
indeed, the CM instantaneously rotates around the contact point with angular speed
˙θ, and from Fig. 8.69, the distance to the contact point is
a2 + R2θ 2. Therefore, the
√
speed of the CM is ωr = ˙θ

a2 + R2θ 2.

The Lagrangian is

(ma2 + mR2θ 2 + I ) ¨θ + mR2θ ˙θ 2 = mga sin θ − mgRθ cos θ .

(8.79)

Let us now consider small oscillations. Using the small-angle approximations,
sin θ ≈ θ and cos θ ≈ 1 − θ 2/2, and keeping terms up to first order in θ , we obtain
(ma2 + I ) ¨θ + mg(R − a)θ = 0.
The coefficient of θ is positive if a < R. Therefore, oscillatory motion occurs if a < R.
Note that this condition is independent of b. The frequency of small oscillations is

If a ≥ R, then the rectangle falls off the cylinder.

Remarks: Let’s look at some special cases. If I = 0 (that is, all of the rectangle’s
(cid:4)
mass is located at the CM), we have ω =
g(R − a)/a2. If in addition a (cid:4) R, then
ω ≈
gR/a2. You can also derive these results by considering the CM to be a point
mass sliding in a parabolic potential. If the rectangle is instead a uniform horizontal
stick, so that a (cid:4) R, a (cid:4) b, and I ≈ mb2/3, then we have ω ≈
3gR/b2. If the
rectangle is a vertical stick (satisfying a < R), so that b (cid:4) a and I ≈ ma2/3, then we
have ω ≈

3g(R − a)/4a2. If in addition a (cid:4) R, then ω ≈

3gR/4a2.

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

Without doing much work, there are two other ways we can determine the condition
under which there is oscillatory motion. The first is to look at the height of the CM
(although this is essentially what we ended up doing in the solution above). Using
small-angle approximations in Eq. (8.76), the height of the CM is y ≈ (R + a) +

8.9 Solutions

353

(R − a)θ 2/2. Therefore, if a < R, the potential energy increases with θ , so the
rectangle wants to decrease its θ and fall back down to the middle. But if a > R, the
potential energy decreases with θ, so the rectangle wants to increase its θ and fall off
the cylinder.

The second way is to look at the horizontal positions of the CM and the contact
point. Small-angle approximations in Eq. (8.76) show that the former equals aθ and
the latter equals Rθ. Therefore, if a < R then the CM is to the left of the contact point,
so the torque from gravity (relative to the contact point) makes θ decrease, and the
motion is stable. But if a > R then the torque from gravity makes θ increase, and the
motion is unstable. ♣

The resulting value of η is 0.378. If you actually run this program on Maple with
different values of g, you will find that the result for n doesn’t depend on g, as stated
above. A few results for η for various values of r are, in (r, η) notation: (0, 0.349),
(1, 0.378), (2, 0.410), (10, 0.872), (20, 3.290). It turns out that r ≈ 11.25 yields η ≈ 1.
That is, the mass m gets to the end of the tube right when the tube becomes vertical.
For η values larger than 1, we could imagine attaching a massless tubular extension
on the end of the given tube. It turns out that η → ∞ as r → ∞. In this case, the
mass m drops nearly straight down, causing the tube to quickly swing down to a nearly
vertical position. But m ends up slightly to one side and then takes a very long time to
move over to become directly below the pivot.

8.6. Minimum I

The shape should be a cylinder with the z axis as its symmetry axis. A quick proof
(by contradiction) is as follows. Assume that the optimal blob is not a cylinder, and
consider the surface of the blob. If the blob is not a cylinder, then there exist two
points on the surface, P1 and P2, that are located at different distances, r1 and r2,
from the z axis. Assume r1 < r2 (see Fig. 8.70). If we move a small piece of the
r2 dm. Therefore, the
blob from P2 to P1, then we decrease the moment of inertia,
proposed noncylindrical blob cannot be the one with the smallest I . In order to avoid
this contradiction, all points on the surface must be equidistant from the z axis. The
only blob with this property is a cylinder.

This is true because dm is proportional to the area, which is proportional to
length squared, so the corresponding dm’s differ by a factor of 4. And then
there are the two powers of r in the integrand. Therefore, when changing vari-
ables from one square to the other, there are four powers of 2 in the integral

(a) The scaling argument here is a little trickier than the one in Section 8.3.2. Our
object is self-similar to an object 3 times as big, so let’s increase the length by a
x2 dm, the x’s pick up a
factor of 3 and see what happens to I . In the integral
factor of 3, so this gives a factor of 9. But what happens to the dm? Well, tripling
the size of our object increases its mass by a factor of 2, because the new object
is made up of two of the smaller ones, plus some empty space in the middle.
So the dm picks up a factor of 2. Therefore, the I for an object of length 3(cid:2) is
18 times the I for an object of length (cid:2), assuming that the axes pass through
any two corresponding points. With pictures, we have (the following symbols

This is larger than the I for a uniform stick, namely m(cid:2)2/12, because the mass

Remark: When we increase the length of our object by a factor of 3, the factor
of 2 in the dm is larger than the factor of 1 relevant to a zero-dimensional object,
but smaller than the factor of 3 relevant to a one-dimensional object. So in some
sense our object has a dimension between 0 and 1. It is reasonable to define the
fractal dimension, d, of an object as the number for which rd is the increase in
“volume” when the dimensions are increased by a factor of r. In this problem,
we have 3d = 2, so d = log3 2 ≈ 0.63. ♣

The above sums might make this solution look a bit involved. But the idea is simply

shown are equal and opposite, and they have the same lever arm relative to the origin.

8.10. Removing a support

(a) First solution Let the desired force from the left support be F, and let the
downward acceleration of the stick’s CM be a. Then the F = ma and τ = I α
(relative to the fixed support; see Fig. 8.72) equations, along with the circular-
motion relation between a and α, are, respectively,

And the first equation then gives F = mg/4. Note that the right end of the stick
accelerates at 2a = 3g/2, which is larger than g.
Second solution Looking at torques around the CM, and also torques around
the fixed support, we have, respectively,

(b) First solution As in the first solution above, we have (using the parallel-axis

theorem; see Fig. 8.73)

mg − F = ma, mgd = (βmr2 + md2)α,

a = αd.

(8.91)

Solving for F gives F = mg/(1 + d2/βr2). For d = r and β = 1/3, we obtain
the answer in part (a).
Second solution As in the second solution above, looking at torques around
the CM, and also torques around the fixed support, we have, respectively,

Fd = (βmr2)α,

and mgd = (βmr2 + md2)α.

(8.92)

Dividing the first of these equations by the second gives F = mg/(1 + d2/βr2).

Remarks: For the special case d = r, we have the following: If β = 0 (point
mass in the middle) then F = 0; if β = 1 (dumbbell with masses at the ends)
then F = mg/2; and if β = ∞ (masses at the ends of long massless extensions
of the stick) then F = mg. These all make intuitive sense. In the limit d = 0, we
have F = mg. And in the limit d = ∞ (using a massless extension), we have
β r here. ♣
F = 0. Technically, we should be writing d (cid:4)

8.11. Falling stick

(a) Let’s calculate τ and L relative to the pivot point. The torque is due to gravity,
which effectively acts on the CM and has magnitude mgb. The moment of inertia
of the stick around the horizontal axis through the pivot (and perpendicular to
the massless stick) is simply mb2. So when the stick starts to fall, the τ = dL/dt

8.9 Solutions

equation is mgb = (mb2)α. Therefore, the initial acceleration of the CM, namely
bα, is

bα = g,
(8.93)
which is independent of (cid:2) and b. This answer makes sense. The stick initially
falls straight down, and the pivot provides no force because it doesn’t know right
away that the stick is moving.

(b) The only change from part (a) is the moment of inertia of the stick around the
horizontal axis through the pivot (and perpendicular to the massless stick). From
the parallel-axis theorem, this moment is mb2 +m(cid:2)2/12. So when the stick starts
to fall, the τ = dL/dt equation is mgb = (mb2 +m(cid:2)2/12)α. Therefore, the initial
acceleration of the CM is

bα =

g
1 + ((cid:2)2/12b2) .

(8.94)

For (cid:2) (cid:4) b, this goes to g, as it should. And for (cid:2) (cid:6) b, it goes to zero, as it
should. In this case, a tiny movement of the CM corresponds to a very large
movement of the points far out along the stick. Therefore, by conservation of
energy, the CM must be moving very slowly.

8.12. Pulling a cylinder

Consider the net force in the y direction (the transverse direction) on an infinitesimal
arclength of the cylinder. Measure θ clockwise from the bottom, as shown in Fig. 8.74.
The tension increases as θ increases (assuming T1 > T2), and the friction force Ff on
the cylinder equals the difference dT in the tension from one end of the small arc to the
other (using Newton’s third law, and noting that there can be no net force on the string
because it is massless). The friction force on the cylinder therefore produces a force
component dT sin θ in the y direction. From the example in Section 2.1, the normal
force on the cylinder is N = T dθ, which yields a force component T dθ cos θ in the
y direction. The net y-force on the cylinder at the little arc is therefore

dθ

N

Fig. 8.74

dFy = dT sin θ + T dθ cos θ = d(T sin θ ).

The total Fy on the cylinder is thus

(cid:14)

Fy =

dFy =

d(T sin θ) = (cid:16)(T sin θ ).

(8.95)

(8.96)

But θ runs from 0 to π, which means that sin θ starts and ends at zero. Therefore, the
total change in T sin θ equals zero, and so Fy = 0, as desired. Note that nowhere in
this solution did we assume anything about T . The string might be slipping, and the
cylinder might be rough in some places and smooth in others, and it doesn’t matter.
The total Fy is still zero (as we know it must be, from the simpler reasoning that T1
and T2 pull only in the x direction). Physically, what happens is that N is larger in the
top half of the semicircle than in the bottom half, and the resulting net downward force
cancels the upward force from the friction.

The above Fy = (cid:16)(T sin θ) result holds in general, and not just when the string
wraps around a semicircle. Because of our convention for θ , the signs work out so that
(cid:16)(T sin θ ) is simply the sum of the y components of the tensions T1 and T2, which is
the answer we expect.

8.13. Oscillating ball

Let the angle from the bottom of the cylinder to the ball be θ (see Fig. 8.75), and let
Ff be the friction force. Then the tangential F = ma equation is

Ff − mg sin θ = ma,
where we have chosen rightward to be the positive direction for a and Ff . Also, the
τ = I α equation (relative to the CM) is

slipping condition rα = a, the torque equation becomes Ff = −(2/5)ma. Plugging
this into Eq. (8.97), and using sin θ ≈ θ , we obtain mgθ + (7/5)ma = 0. Under the
assumption r (cid:4) R, the center of the ball moves along a circle with radius essentially

Remarks: The answer in Eq. (8.100) is slightly smaller than the
the case where the ball slides. In terms of forces, the reason for this is that the friction
force causes there to be a smaller net tangential force. In terms of energy, the reason
is that energy is “lost” in the rotational motion, so the ball ends up moving slower.

If we omit the r (cid:4) R assumption, then the rα = a relation still holds, because
we can consider the ball to be instantaneously rotating around the contact point. But
the a = R ¨θ relation is replaced by a = (R − r) ¨θ , because the center of the ball
moves along a circle of radius R − r. Therefore, the exact result for the frequency is
ω =

5g/7(R − r). This goes to infinity as r → R. ♣

8.14. Oscillating cylinders

The moments of inertia of the cylinders are I1 = M1R2
2. Let F be the
force between the two cylinders, defined with rightward on the small cylinder being
positive. Let θ1 and θ2 be the angles of rotation of the cylinders, with counterclockwise
positive, relative to the position where the small cylinder is at the bottom of the big
cylinder. Then the torque equations are

R1 (cid:4) R2, the nonslipping condition says that R2θ ≈ R2θ2 − R1θ1, since both sides
of this equation are expressions for the arclength away from the bottom of the big
cylinder. Adding Eqs. (8.101) after dividing through by the masses then gives

8.15. Lengthening the string

Consider the angular momentum relative to the support point P. The forces on the mass
are the tension in the string and gravity. The former provides no torque around P, and
the latter provides no torque in the z direction. Therefore, Lz is constant. The motion
is always approximately circular because the length of the string changes very slowly,
so if we let ω(cid:2) be the frequency of the circular motion when the string has length (cid:2),
then we can say that

Lz = mr2ω(cid:2)
(8.106)
is constant. The frequency ω(cid:2) can be obtained by using F = ma for the circular motion.
The tension in the string is essentially mg/ cos θ (to make the forces in the y direction
cancel), so the horizontal radial force is mg tan θ. Therefore,

This holds at all times, so the quantity r2/

√

r ∝ (cid:2)1/4,
which means that r grows very slowly as you let the string out when θ ≈ 0.

√

(b) For θ ≈ π/2, we have r ≈ (cid:2), so Eq. (8.108) says that (cid:2)2/

h is constant.

(cid:2) is constant. Therefore,
(8.109)

Therefore,

h ∝ (cid:2)4,
(8.110)
which means that h grows very quickly as you let the string out when θ ≈ π/2.
Note that Eq. (8.108) says that h ∝ r4 for any value of θ . So no matter what
θ is, if you slowly lengthen the string so that r doubles, then h increases by a
factor of 16. Equivalently, if you draw the string in, the envelope of the motion
of the mass is a surface of revolution generated by a curve of the form y ∝ −x4.

8.16. A triangle of cylinders

(a) Let N be the normal force between the cylinders, and let F be the friction force
from the ground (see Fig. 8.77). Let ax be the initial horizontal acceleration of
the right bottom cylinder (so α = ax/R is its angular acceleration), and let ay be
the initial vertical acceleration of the top cylinder, with downward taken to be
positive.

If we consider the torque around the center of one of the bottom cylinders,
then the only relevant force is F, because N , gravity, and the normal force from
the ground all point through the center. The equations for Fx = max on the
bottom right cylinder, Fy = may on the top cylinder, and τ = I α on the bottom
right cylinder are, respectively,

Fortunately, ax and ay are related. The contact surface between the top and

if the bottom cylinders move a distance d to the side, then the top cylinder moves
a distance d tan 30◦ downward. Hence,

be the initial vertical acceleration of the top cylinder, with downward taken to
be positive. Let α be the angular acceleration of the right bottom cylinder, with
counterclockwise taken to be positive. Note that α is not equal to ax/R, because
the bottom cylinders slip on the ground.

If we consider the torque around the center of one of the bottom cylinders,
then the only relevant force is F. And from the same reasoning as in part (a), we
have ax =

(8.114)

We have five unknowns, N , F, ax, ay, and α, so we need one more equation.
The tricky part is relating α to ax. One way to do this is to ignore the y motion
of the top cylinder and imagine the bottom right cylinder to be rotating up and
around the top cylinder, which is held fixed. In this rotational motion, the center
of the bottom cylinder moves at an angle of 30◦ with respect to the horizontal
(at the start). So if it moves an infinitesimal distance d to the right, then its center
moves a distance d/ cos 30◦ up and to the right. So the angle through which the
bottom cylinder rotates is θ = (d/ cos 30◦)/R = (2/
3)(d/R). Bringing back
in the vertical motion of the top cylinder doesn’t change this result. Therefore,
taking two derivatives of this relation gives

If β = 0, that is, if all the mass is at the center of the cylinders, then
Remarks:
the results in both parts (a) and (b) reduce to g/7. This β = 0 case is equivalent
to the case of frictionless cylinders (of any mass distribution), because then
nothing rotates. If β (cid:13)= 0, then the result in part (b) is smaller than that in
part (a). This isn’t so obvious, but the basic reason is that the bottom cylinders in
part (b) take up more energy because they have to rotate slightly faster, because
α = (2/

3)(ax/R) instead of α = ax/R. ♣

8.17. Falling chimney

Let θ be the angle through which the chimney has fallen. Before we start dealing with
the forces in the rods, let’s first determine ¨θ as a function of θ . Let (cid:2) be the height
of the chimney. Then the moment of inertia around the pivot point on the ground is
m(cid:2)2/3 (if we ignore the width). And the torque (around the pivot point) due to gravity
is τ = mg((cid:2)/2) sin θ. Therefore, τ = dL/dt gives mg((cid:2)/2) sin θ = (1/3)m(cid:2)2 ¨θ ,
and so

¨θ = 3g sin θ

.

(8.117)

2(cid:2)
Let’s now determine the forces in the rods. Our strategy will be to imagine that the
chimney consists of a chimney of height h, with another chimney of height (cid:2)−h placed
on top of it. We’ll find the forces in the rods connecting these two “sub-chimneys,”
and then we’ll maximize one of these forces (T2, defined below) as a function of h.

The forces on the top piece are gravity and also the forces from the two rods at each
end of the bottom board. Let’s break these latter forces up into transverse and longi-
tudinal forces along the chimney. Let T1 and T2 be the two longitudinal components,
and let F be the sum of the transverse components, as shown in Fig. 8.79. We have
picked the positive directions for T1 and T2 so that positive T1 corresponds to com-
pression in the left rod, and positive T2 corresponds to tension in the right rod (which
is what the forces will turn out to be, as we’ll see). It turns out that if the width (which
we’ll call 2r) is much less than the height, then T2 (cid:6) F (as we’ll see below), so the
tension in the right rod is essentially equal to T2. We will therefore be concerned with
maximizing T2.

In writing down the force and torque equations for the top piece, we have three
equations (the radial and tangential F = ma equations, and τ = dL/dt around the
CM), and three unknowns (F, T1, and T2). If we define the fraction f ≡ h/(cid:2), then
the top piece has length (1 − f )(cid:2) and mass (1 − f )m, and its CM travels in a circle of
radius (1 + f )(cid:2)/2, Therefore, our three force and torque equations are, respectively,

T2 − T1 + (1 − f )mg cos θ = (1 − f )m

At this point, we could plow forward and solve this system of three equations in three

T1 + T2 is of order 1/r, and the first equation says that T2 − T1 is of order 1. These
imply that T1 ≈ T2, to leading order in 1/r. Therefore, we can set T1 + T2 ≈ 2T2 in the
third equation. Using this approximation, along with the value of ¨θ from Eq. (8.117),
the second and third equations become

Therefore, the chimney is most likely to break at a point one-third of the way up
(assuming that the width is much less than the height). Interestingly, f = 1/3 makes
the force F in Eq. (8.120) exactly equal to zero. For more on the falling chimney, see
Madsen (1977) and Varieschi and Kamiya (2003).

8.18. Ball hitting stick

Let V , v, and ω be the speed of the ball, the speed of the stick’s CM, and the angular
speed of the stick, respectively, after the collision. Then conservation of momentum,
angular momentum (around the fixed point that coincides with the initial center of the
stick), and energy give

MV0d = MVd + βm(cid:2)2ω,
MV 2

We must solve these three equations for V , v, and ω. The first two equations quickly
give vd = β(cid:2)2ω. Solving for V in the first equation and plugging the result into the
third, and then eliminating ω through vd = β(cid:2)2ω gives

Eq. (8.123) is of course V = V0, v = 0, and ω = 0. The initial conditions certainly
satisfy conservation of p, L, and E with the initial conditions (a fine tautology, indeed).
Nowhere in Eq. (8.123) does it say that the ball actually hits the stick.

8.19. A ball and stick theorem

As in the solution to Problem 8.18, we have

MV0 = MV + mv,
MV0d = MVd + I ω,
MV 2
0

= MV 2 + mv2 + I ω2.

(8.126)

The speed of the contact point on the stick right after the collision equals the speed
of the CM plus the rotational speed relative to the CM. In other words, it equals v +ωd.
The desired relative speed is therefore (v + ωd) − V . We can determine the value of
this relative speed by solving the above three equations for V , v, and ω. Equivalently,
we can just use the results of Problem 8.18. There is, however, a much more appealing
method, which is the following.

The first two equations quickly give mvd = I ω. The last equation may then be

written as, using I ω2 = (I ω)ω = (mvd)ω,

M (V0 − V )(V0 + V ) = mv(v + ωd).

Since we are told that |vy| is unchanged by the bounce, we can ignore it when applying
conservation of energy. And since the vertical impulse from the floor provides no
torque around the ball’s CM, we can completely ignore the y motion in this problem.
The horizontal impulse from the floor is responsible for changing both vx and ω.

motion on a frictionless plane. The nontrivial solution we will find shortly is the nonslipping one.
Basically, to conserve energy, there must be no work done by friction. And since work is force
times distance, this means that either (1) the plane is frictionless, so that the force is zero, or (2)
there is no relative motion between the ball’s contact point and the plane, so that the distance is
zero. The latter case is the one we are concerned with here.

The square of the matrix turns out to be the identity. Therefore, after two bounces,
both vx and ω return to their original values. The ball then repeats the motion of
the previous two bounces (and so on, after every two bounces). The only difference
between successive pairs of bounces is that the ball may shift horizontally. You are
strongly encouraged to experimentally verify this interesting periodic behavior.

8.22. Rolling over a bump

We will use the fact that the angular momentum of the ball with respect to the corner
of the step (call this point P) is unchanged by the collision. This is true because any
forces exerted at point P provide zero torque around P. (The torque from gravity
will be relevant during the subsequent rising-up motion. But during the instantaneous
collision, L does not change.) This fact will allow us to find the energy of the ball right
after the collision, which we will then require to be greater than mgh.

Breaking the initial L into the contribution relative to the CM, plus the contribution
from the ball treated like a point mass located at the CM, we see that the initial angular
momentum is L = (2/5)mR2ω0 + mV0(R − h), where ω0 is the initial angular speed.
But the nonslipping condition tells us that ω0 = V0/R, so we can write L as

Let ω(cid:16) be the angular speed of the ball around point P immediately after the colli-
sion. The parallel-axis theorem says that the moment of inertia around P is equal to
(2/5)mR2 + mR2 = (7/5)mR2. Conservation of L around P during the collision then

It is possible for the ball to rise up over the step even if h > R, provided
Remarks:
that the ball sticks to the corner, without slipping. (If h > R, the step would have to be
“hollowed out” so that the ball doesn’t collide with the side of the step.) But note that
V0 → ∞ as h → 7R/5. For h ≥ 7R/5, it is impossible for the ball to make it up over
the step, no matter how large V0 is. The ball will get pushed down into the ground,
instead of rising up, if h > 7R/5.

For an object with a general moment of inertia I = βmR2 (so β = 2/5 in our

problem), you can show that the minimum initial speed is

This decreases as β increases. It is smallest when the “ball” is a wheel with all the

over the step even if h is close to 2R. ♣

Let v0 and v be the speeds of the CM right before and right after the collision (so we
know that v0 =
2gH ). The I for a square is the same as the I for a stick, (1/12)m(cid:2)2,

After the collision, the time to hit the ground is given by vt + gt2/2 = h. Solving

for t, setting ωt = π for half a rotation, and using the v and ω we just found, yields

(8.147)

The special value of (cid:2) is (cid:2) = (6/π)h (which would be a huge piece of toast), in which
case H = ∞. If (cid:2) is larger than (6/π)h, then there isn’t enough time to make half a
rotation before hitting the floor. The intuitive reason for this is that since ω = 6v/(cid:2)
(from above), there is no way to increase ω without also increasing v. The toast has the
best chance of making half a rotation if v is very large, because then gravity doesn’t
have any time to increase v. In this limit, the toast makes half a rotation upon hitting
the floor if π/ω = h/v. Plugging in ω = 6v/(cid:2) gives 6h = π(cid:2), as desired.

16 The minus sign on the right-hand side comes from the fact that we’re defining the v’s to be positive
downward. Equivalently, the force from the counter increases the angular speed but decreases the
linear speed.

Angular momentum, Part I (Constant ˆL)

For the reasonable values of h = 1 m and (cid:2) = 10 cm, we obtain H ≈ 3 mm, which
is quite small. You should try this with a pencil to convince yourself that even this
small distance can yield the desired (or rather, undesired) half rotation.

8.24. Sliding to rolling

(a) Define all linear quantities to be positive to the right, and all angular quantities
to be positive clockwise, as shown in Fig. 8.80. Then, for example, the friction
force Ff is negative. The friction force slows down the translational motion and
speeds up the rotational motion, according to

Ff = ma,

and − Ff R = I α.

(8.148)

Eliminating Ff , and using I = βmR2, gives a = −βRα. Integrating this over
time, up to the time when the ball stops slipping, gives

(cid:16)V = −βR(cid:16)ω.

(8.149)

Note that we could have obtained this by simply using the impulse equation,
Eq. (8.61). Using (cid:16)V = Vf −V0, and (cid:16)ω = ωf −ω0 = ωf , and also ωf = Vf /R
(the nonslipping condition), Eq. (8.149) gives

Vf = V0

1 + β ,

(8.150)

independent of the nature of Ff . Ff can depend on position, time, speed, or
anything else. The relation a = −βRα, and hence also Eq. (8.149), will still be
true at all times.

Remark: We can also calculate τ and L relative to a dot painted on the ground
that is the contact point at a given instant. There is zero torque relative to this
point. To find L, we must add the L of the CM and the L relative to the CM.
Therefore, τ = dL/dt gives 0 = (d/dt)(mvR + βmR2ω), and so a = −βRα, as
above. ♣

For β → 0, no energy is lost, which makes sense. And for β → ∞ (a spool
sliding on its axle), all the energy is lost, which also makes sense, because we
essentially have a sliding block which can’t rotate.

(b) Let’s first find t. The friction force is Ff = −µmg, so F = ma gives −µg = a.
Therefore, (cid:16)V = at = −µgt. But Eq. (8.150) says that (cid:16)V ≡ Vf − V0 =
−V0β/(1 + β). Therefore,

t =

For β → 0, we have t → 0, which makes sense. And for β → ∞, we have
t → V0/(µg), which equals the time a sliding block would take to stop.

Let’s now find d. We have d = V0t +(1/2)at2. Using a = −µg, and plugging

The two extreme cases for β check here.

To calculate the work done by friction, we might be tempted to write down the
product Ff d, with Ff = −µmg and d given in Eq. (8.153). But the result doesn’t
equal the loss in kinetic energy calculated in Eq. (8.151). What’s wrong with
this reasoning? The error is that the friction force does not act over a distance d.
To find the distance over which Ff acts, we must find how far the surface of
the ball moves relative to the ground. The speed of a dot on the ball that is
instantaneously the contact point is Vrel(t) = V (t) − Rω(t) = (V0 + at) − Rαt.
Using α = −a/βR and a = −µg, this becomes
Vrel(t) = V0 − 1 + β

The work done by friction is Ff drel = −µmgdrel, which does indeed give the

8.25. Lots of sticks

Consider the collision between two sticks. Let V be the speed of the contact point on
the heavy one. Since this stick is essentially infinitely heavy, we may consider it to
be an infinitely heavy ball, moving at speed V . The rotational degree of freedom of
the heavy stick is irrelevant, as far as the light stick is concerned. We can therefore
invoke the result of Problem 8.19 to say that the relative speed of the contact points is
the same before and after the collision. This implies that the contact point on the light
stick picks up a speed of 2V , because the heavy stick is essentially unaffected by the
collision and keeps moving at speed V .

Let us now find the speed of the other end of the light stick. This stick receives an

impulse from the heavy stick, so we can apply Eq. (8.61) to the light stick to obtain

(cid:16)L = r(cid:16)p =⇒ βmr2ω = r(mvCM) =⇒ rω =

vCM
β .

(8.156)

The speed of the struck (top) end is vtop = rω + vCM, because the CM speed adds to the
rotational speed. The speed of the other (bottom) end is vbot = rω − vCM, because the
CM speed subtracts from the rotational speed.17 The ratio of these speeds is

vbot
vtop

=

vCM
β − vCM
vCM
β + vCM

= 1 − β
1 + β .

(8.157)

This is a general result whenever you strike the end of a stick with any force. In the
present problem, we have vtop = 2V . Therefore,

vbot = V

2(1 − β)

17 Since β ≤ 1 for any real stick, we have rω = vCM/β ≥ vCM. Therefore, rω − vCM is greater

than or equal to zero.

370

Angular momentum, Part I (Constant ˆL)

The same analysis holds for all the other collisions. Therefore, the bottom ends of the
sticks move with speeds that form a geometric progression with ratio 2(1 − β)/(1 +
β). If this ratio is less than 1 (that is, if β > 1/3), then the speeds go to zero as
n → ∞. If it is greater than 1 (that is, if β < 1/3), then the speeds go to infinity
as n → ∞. If it equals 1 (that is, if β = 1/3), then the speeds remain equal to V and
are thus independent of n, as we wanted to show. A uniform stick has β = 1/3 relative
to its center (which is usually written in the form I = m(cid:2)2/12, where (cid:2) = 2r).

In Chapter 8, we discussed situations where the direction of the vector L remained
constant, and only its magnitude changed. In this chapter, we will look at more
general situations where the direction of L is allowed to change. The vector
nature of L will prove to be vital here, and we will arrive at all sorts of strange
results for spinning tops and such things. This chapter is rather long, alas, but the
general outline is that the first three sections cover general theory, then Section 9.4
introduces some actual physical setups, and then Section 9.6 begins the discussion
of tops.

9.1 Preliminaries concerning rotations

9.1.1 The form of general motion

Before getting started, we should make sure we’re all on the same page concerning
a few important things about rotations. Because rotations generally involve three
dimensions, they can often be hard to visualize. A rough drawing on a piece of
paper might not do the trick. For this reason, this chapter is one of the more
difficult ones in this book. But to ease into it, the next few pages consist of some
definitions and helpful theorems. This first theorem describes the general form
of any motion. You might consider it obvious, but it’s a little tricky to prove.

Theorem 9.1 (Chasles’theorem) Consider a rigid body undergoing arbitrary
motion. Pick any point P in the body. Then at any instant (see Fig. 9.1), the
motion of the body can be written as the sum of the translational motion of P,
plus a rotation around some axis (which may change with time) through P.1

z

P

V

ω

y

Proof: The motion of the body can be written as the sum of the translational
motion of P, plus some other motion relative to P (this is true because relative
coordinates are additive quantities). We must show that this latter motion is a
rotation. This seems quite plausible, and it holds because the body is rigid; that is,

x

Fig. 9.1

1 In other words, a person at rest with respect to a frame whose origin is P, and whose axes are
parallel to the fixed-frame axes, sees the body undergoing a rotation around some axis through P.

371

372

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

all points keep the same distances relative to each other. If the body weren’t rigid,
then this theorem wouldn’t be true.

To be rigorous, consider a spherical shell fixed in the body, centered at P. The
motion of the body is completely determined by the motion of the points on this
sphere, so we need only examine what happens to the sphere. Because distances
are preserved in the rigid body, the points on the sphere must always remain the
same radial distance from P. And because we are looking at motion relative to P,
we have therefore reduced the problem to the following: In what manner can a
rigid sphere transform into itself? We claim that any such transformation has the
property that there exist two points that end up where they started.2 These two
points must then be diametrically opposite points (assuming that the whole sphere
doesn’t end up back where it started, in which case every point ends up where it
started), because distances are preserved; given one point that ends up where it
started, the diametrically opposite point must also end up where it started, to
maintain the distance of a diameter.

If this claim is true, then we are done, because for an infinitesimal transfor-
mation, a given point moves in only one direction, because there is no time to do
any turning. So a point that ends up where it started must have remained fixed
for the whole (infinitesimal) time. Therefore, all the points on the diameter join-
ing the two fixed points must also have remained fixed the whole time, because
distances are preserved. So we are left with a rotation around this axis.

This “two points ending up where they started” claim is quite believable,
but nevertheless tricky to prove. Claims with these properties are always fun to
think about, so I’ve left this one as a problem (Problem 9.2). Try to solve it on
(cid:1)
your own.

We will invoke this theorem repeatedly in this chapter (often without bothering
to say so). Note that we are assuming that P is a point in the body, because we
used the fact that P keeps the same distances from other points in the body.

new ω

Remark: A situation where this theorem isn’t so obvious is the following (this setup contains
only rotation, with no translation of the point P). Consider an object rotating around a fixed
axis, the stick shown in Fig. 9.2. But now imagine grabbing the stick and rotating it around
some other axis (the dotted line shown). It isn’t immediately obvious that the resulting motion
is (instantaneously) a rotation around some new axis through the point P (which remains fixed).
But indeed it is. We’ll be quantitative about this in the “Rotating sphere” example later in this
section. ♣

Fig. 9.2

9.1.2 The angular velocity vector
It is extremely useful to introduce the angular velocity vector, ω, which is defined
as the vector that points along the axis of rotation, and whose magnitude equals

2 This claim is actually true for any transformation of a rigid sphere into itself, but for the present
purposes we are concerned only with infinitesimal transformations, because we are looking only
at what happens at a given instant in time.

9.1 Preliminaries concerning rotations

373

the angular speed. The choice of the two possible directions along the axis is given
by the right-hand rule: if you curl your right-hand fingers in the direction of the
spin, then your thumb points in the direction of ω. For example, a spinning record
has ω perpendicular to the record, through the center (as shown in Fig. 9.3),3 with
its magnitude equal to the angular speed, ω. The points on the axis of rotation
are the ones that (instantaneously) do not move. Of course, the direction of ω
may change over time, so the points that were formerly on the axis may now be
moving.

Remarks:

1. If you want, you can break the mold and use the left-hand rule to determine ω, as long as
you use it consistently. The direction of ω will be the opposite, but that doesn’t matter,
because ω isn’t really physical. Any physical result (for example, the velocity of a particle,
given below in Theorem 9.2) will come out the same, independent of which hand you
(consistently) use.

(cid:6)

2. The fact that we can specify a rotation by specifying a vector ω is a peculiarity to three
dimensions. If we lived in one dimension, then there would be no such thing as a rotation.
If we lived in two dimensions, then all rotations would take place in that plane, so we
could label a rotation by simply giving its speed, ω. In three dimensions, rotations take
= 3 independent planes. And we choose to label these, for convenience, by
place in
the directions orthogonal to these planes, and by the angular speed in each plane. If we
= 6 planes, so we would
lived in four dimensions, then rotations could take place in
have to label a rotation by giving 6 planes and 6 angular speeds. Note that a vector, which
has four components in four dimensions, would not do the trick. ♣

In addition to specifying the points that are instantaneously motionless, ω
also easily produces the velocity of any point in the rotating object. Consider
the situation where the axis of rotation passes through the origin, which we’ll
generally assume to be the case in this chapter, unless otherwise stated. Then we
have the following theorem.

Theorem 9.2 Given an object rotating with angular velocity ω, the velocity
of a point at position r is given by

v = ω × r.

(9.1)

Proof: Drop a perpendicular from the point in question (call it P) to the axis ω.
Let Q be the foot of the perpendicular, and let r(cid:16) be the vector from Q to P

3 It’s actually meaningless to say that ω passes through the center of the record, because you can
draw the vector anywhere, and it’s still the same vector, as long as it has the correct magnitude and
direction. Nevertheless, it’s customary to draw ω along the axis of rotation and to say things like,
“An object rotates around ω . . .”

(see Fig. 9.4). From the properties of the cross product (see Appendix B), v =
ω × r is orthogonal to ω, r, and also r(cid:16) because r(cid:16) is a linear combination of ω
and r. Therefore, the direction of v is correct; it is always orthogonal to ω and
r(cid:16), so it describes circular motion around the axis ω. Also, by the right-hand rule
in the cross product (or the left-hand rule, if you had chosen to be different and
defined ω that way), v has the proper orientation around ω, namely into the page
at the instant shown. And since

Fig. 9.4

|v| = |ω||r| sin θ = ωr

(cid:16)

,

(9.2)

we see that v has the correct magnitude, because ωr(cid:16) is the speed of the circular
motion around ω. So v is indeed the correct velocity vector. (If we have the
special case where P lies along ω, then r is parallel to ω, so the cross product
(cid:1)
gives a zero result for v, as it should.)

We’ll make good use of Eq. (9.1) and apply it repeatedly throughout this
chapter. Even if it’s hard to visualize what’s going on in a given rotation, all you
have to do to find the speed of any point is calculate the cross product ω × r.
Conversely, if the speed of every point in a body is given by v = ω × r, then the
body must be undergoing a rotation with angular velocity ω, because all points
on the axis ω are motionless, and all other points move with the proper speed for
this rotation.

A very nice thing about angular velocities is that they simply add. Stated more

precisely:

Theorem 9.3 Let coordinate systems S1, S2, and S3 have a common origin.
Let S1 rotate with angular velocity ω1,2 with respect to S2, and let S2 rotate with
angular velocity ω2,3 with respect to S3. Then S1 rotates (instantaneously) with
angular velocity

ω1,3 = ω1,2 + ω2,3

(9.3)

with respect to S3.

If ω1,2 and ω2,3 point in the same direction, then the theorem is clear;
Proof:
the angular speeds just add. If, however, they don’t point in the same direction,
then things are a bit harder to visualize. But we can prove the theorem by making
abundant use of the definition of ω.

Pick a point P1 at rest in S1. Let r be the vector from the origin to P1. The
velocity of P1 (relative to a very close point P2 at rest in S2) due to the rotation of
S1 around ω1,2 is VP1P2
= ω1,2 × r. The velocity of P2 (relative to a very close
= ω2,3 × r,
point P3 at rest in S3) due to the rotation of S2 around ω2,3 is VP2P3
because P2 is also located essentially at position r. Therefore, the velocity of P1
= (ω1,2 + ω2,3) × r. This holds for any point
relative to P3 is VP1P2
P1 at rest in S1, so the frame S1 rotates with angular velocity (ω1,2 + ω2,3) with

+ VP2P3

respect to S3. We see that the proof basically comes down to the facts that (1) the
linear velocities just add, as usual, and (2) the angular velocities differ from the
(cid:1)
linear velocities by a cross product with r.

If ω1,2 is constant in S2, then the vector ω1,3 = ω1,2 + ω2,3 will change with
respect to S3 as time goes by, because ω1,2, which is fixed in S2, is changing with
respect to S3 (assuming that ω1,2 and ω2,3 aren’t parallel). But at any instant,
ω1,3 may be obtained by adding the present values of ω1,2 and ω2,3. Consider the
following example.

Example (Rotating sphere): A sphere rotates with angular speed ω3 around a
stick that initially points in the ˆz direction. You grab the stick and rotate it around the
ˆy axis with angular speed ω2. What is the angular velocity of the sphere, with respect
to the lab frame, as time goes by?

In the language of Theorem 9.3, the sphere defines the S1 frame; the stick
Solution:
and the ˆy axis define the S2 frame; and the lab frame is the S3 frame. The instant after
you grab the stick, we are given that ω1,2 = ω3 ˆz, and ω2,3 = ω2 ˆy. Therefore, the
angular velocity of the sphere with respect to the lab frame is ω1,3 = ω1,2 + ω2,3 =
ω3 ˆz + ω2 ˆy, as shown in Fig. 9.5. Convince yourself that the combination of these
two rotations yields zero motion for the points along the line of ω1,3. As time goes
by, the stick (and hence ω1,2) rotates around the y axis, so ω1,3 = ω1,2 + ω2,3 traces
out a cone around the y axis, as shown.

Remark: Note the different behavior of ω1,3 for a slightly different statement of the
problem: Let the sphere initially rotate with angular velocity ω2 ˆy around a stick, and then
grab the stick and rotate it with angular velocity ω3 ˆz. For this situation, ω1,3 initially
points in the same direction as in the original statement of the problem (it initially equals
ω2 ˆy + ω3 ˆz). But as time goes by, it is now the horizontal component (defined by the stick)
of ω1,3 that changes, so ω1,3 = ω1,2 + ω2,3 traces out a cone around the z axis, as shown
in Fig. 9.6. ♣

An important point concerning rotations is that they are defined with respect
to a coordinate system. It makes no sense to ask how fast an object is rotating with
respect to a certain point, or even a certain axis. Consider, for example, an object
rotating with angular velocity ω = ω3 ˆz with respect to the lab frame. Saying only,
“The object has angular velocity ω = ω3 ˆz,” is not sufficient, because someone
standing in the frame of the object would measure ω = 0, and would therefore be
very confused by your statement. Throughout this chapter, we’ll try to remember
to state the coordinate system with respect to which ω is measured. But if we
forget, the default frame is the lab frame.

This section was definitely a bit abstract, so don’t worry too much about it
at the moment. The best strategy is perhaps to read on, and then come back
for a second pass after digesting a few more sections. At any rate, we’ll be

discussing many other aspects (probably more than you’d ever want to know)
of ω in Section 9.7.2, so you’re assured of getting a lot more practice with it.
For now, if you want to strain some brain cells thinking about ω vectors, you are
encouraged to solve Problem 9.3, and also to look at the three given solutions.

9.2 The inertia tensor

Given an object undergoing general motion, the inertia tensor is what relates the
angular momentum, L, to the angular velocity, ω. This tensor (which is just a
fancy name for “matrix” in this context) depends on the geometry of the object,
as we’ll see. In finding the L due to general motion, we’ll follow the strategy of
Section 8.1. We’ll first look at the special case of rotation around an axis through
the origin, then we’ll look at the most general possible motion.

9.2.1 Rotation around an axis through the origin
The three-dimensional object in Fig. 9.7 rotates with angular velocity ω. Consider
a little piece of the body, with mass dm and position r. The velocity of this piece is
v = ω×r, so its angular momentum (relative to the origin) is r×p = (dm)r×v =
(dm)r × (ω × r). The angular momentum of the entire body is therefore

(cid:14)

L =

r × (ω × r) dm,

where the integration runs over the volume of the body. In the case where the rigid
body is made up of a collection of point masses mi, the angular momentum is

(cid:19)

L =

miri × (ω × ri).

The double cross product in Eqs. (9.4) and (9.5) looks a bit intimidating, but it’s
actually not so bad. First, we have

ω × r =

We’re using the notation ω1 instead of ωx, etc., because there are already enough
x, y, z’s floating around here. The double cross product is then

r × (ω × r) =

For the sake of clarity, we have not bothered to write the dm part of each integral
(and we’ll continue to drop it for most of the remainder of this section). The
matrix I is called the inertia tensor. If the word “tensor” scares you, just ignore
it. I is simply a matrix. It acts on a vector (the angular velocity) and produces
another vector (the angular momentum).

Example (Cube with origin at corner): Calculate the inertia tensor for a solid
cube of mass M and side length L, with the coordinate axes parallel to the edges of
the cube, and the origin at a corner (see Fig. 9.8).

Solution: Due to the symmetry of the cube, there are only two integrals we need
(y2 + z2) dm, and the
to calculate in Eq. (9.8). The diagonal entries are all equal to
xy dm. With dm = ρ dx dy dz, and ρ = M /L3,
off-diagonal entries are all equal to −
these two integrals are

Having found I, we can calculate the angular momentum associated with any given
angular velocity. If, for example, the cube is rotating around the z axis with angu-
lar speed ω, then we can apply the matrix I to the vector (0, 0, ω) to find that the
angular momentum is L = ML2ω(−1/4, −1/4, 2/3). Note the somewhat odd fact

378

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

that Lx and Ly are nonzero, even though the rotation is only around the z axis. We’ll
discuss this issue after the following remarks.

Remarks:

1. The inertia tensor in Eq. (9.8) is a rather formidable-looking object. You will therefore
be very pleased to hear that you rarely have to use it. It’s nice to know that it’s there if
you need it, but the concept of principal axes (discussed in Section 9.3) provides a way
to avoid using the inertia tensor (or more precisely, to greatly simplify it) and is therefore
much more useful in solving problems.

2. I is a symmetric matrix, which is a fact that will be important in Section 9.3. There are

therefore only six independent entries, instead of nine.

mi(y2
i

+ z2
i

).

3. In the case where the rigid body is made up of a collection of point masses mi, the entries

(cid:26)

in the matrix are just sums. For example, the upper left entry is

4. I depends only on the geometry of the object, and not on ω.
5. To construct an I, you not only need to specify the origin, you also need to specify the x, y,
z axes of your coordinate system. And the basis vectors must be orthogonal, because the
cross product calculation above is valid only for an orthonormal basis. If someone else
comes along and chooses a different orthonormal basis (but the same origin), then her I
will have different entries, as will her ω, as will her L. But her ω and L will be exactly the
same vectors as your ω and L. They will appear different only because they are written
in a different coordinate system. A vector is what it is, independent of how you choose to
look at it. If you each point your arm in the direction of what you calculate L to be, then
you will both be pointing in the same direction.

6. For the case of a pancake object rotating in the x-y plane, we have z = 0 for all points in
the object. And ω = ω3 ˆz, so ω1 = ω2 = 0. The only nonzero term in the L in Eq. (9.8)
is therefore L3 =
(x2 + y2) dm ω3, which is simply the Lz = Izω result we found in
Eq. (8.5). ♣

(cid:17)

This is all perfectly fine. Given any rigid body, we can calculate I (relative
to a given origin, using a given set of axes). And given ω, we can then apply I
to it to find L. But what do these entries in I really mean? How do we interpret
them? Note, for example, that ω3 appears not only in L3 in Eq. (9.8), but also in
L1 and L2. But ω3 is relevant to rotations around the z axis, so what in the world
is it doing in L1 and L2? Consider the following examples.

z

ω

r

x

Fig. 9.9

Example 1 (Point mass in the x-y plane): Consider a point mass m traveling
in a circle of radius r (centered at the origin) in the x-y plane, with frequency ω3, as
shown in Fig. 9.9. Using ω = (0, 0, ω3), x2 + y2 = r2, and z = 0 in Eq. (9.8) (with
a discrete sum of only one object, instead of the integrals), the angular momentum
with respect to the origin is

y

L = (0, 0, mr2ω3).

(9.11)

The z component is mr(rω3) = mrv, as it should be. And the x and y components
are zero, as they should be. This case where ω1 = ω2 = 0 and z = 0 is simply
the case we studied in Chapter 8, as mentioned in Remark 6 above.

Example 2 (Point mass in space): Consider a point mass m traveling in a circle
of radius r, with frequency ω3. But now let the circle be centered at the point (0, 0, z0),
with the plane of the circle parallel to the x-y plane, as shown in Fig. 9.10. Using
ω = (0, 0, ω3), x2 + y2 = r2, and z = z0 in Eq. (9.8), the angular momentum with
respect to the origin is

z

z

r

L = mω3(−xz0, −yz0, r2).

(9.12)

ω

The z component is mrv, as it should be. But surprisingly, we have nonzero L1 and
L2, even though the mass is just rotating around the z axis. L does not point along ω
here. What’s going on?

Consider an instant when the mass is in the y-z plane, as shown in Fig. 9.10. The
velocity of the mass is then in the −ˆx direction. Therefore, the particle most certainly
has angular momentum around the y axis, as well as the z axis. Someone looking at a
split-second movie of the mass at this point can’t tell whether it’s rotating around the
y axis, the z axis, or undergoing some complicated motion. But the past and future
motion is irrelevant; at any instant in time, as far as the angular momentum goes, we
are concerned only with what is happening at this instant.

x

Fig. 9.10

y

At this instant, the angular momentum around the y axis is L2 = −mz0v, because
z0 is the distance from the y axis, and the minus sign comes from the right-hand rule.
Using v = ω3r = ω3y, we have L2 = −mz0ω3y, in agreement with Eq. (9.12). Also,
at this instant, L1 is zero, because the velocity is parallel to the x axis. This agrees
with Eq. (9.12), since x = 0. As an exercise, you can check that Eq. (9.12) is also
correct when the mass is at a general point (x, y, z0).

We see that, for example, the Iyz ≡ −

yz entry in I tells us how much the ω3
component of the angular velocity contributes to the L2 component of the angular
momentum. And due to the symmetry of I, the Iyz = Izy entry in I also tells us how
much the ω2 component of the angular velocity contributes to the L3 component of
the angular momentum. In the former case, if we group the product of the various
quantities as −
(ω3y)z, we see that this is simply the appropriate component of the
(ω2z)y, it is
velocity times the distance from the y axis. In the latter case with −
the opposite grouping. But in both cases there is one factor of y and one factor of z,
hence the symmetry in I.

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

Remark: For a point mass, L is actually more easily obtained by just calculating L =
r × p. The result for the instant shown in Fig. 9.10 is drawn in Fig. 9.11, where it is clear
that L has both y and z components, and thus also clear that L doesn’t point along ω. For a
more complicated object, the tensor I is generally used, because it is necessary to perform
the integral of the L = r × p contributions over the entire object, and the tensor has this
integral built into it. At any rate, whatever method you use, you will find that except in
special circumstances (see Section 9.3), L doesn’t point along ω.

Example 3 (Two point masses): Let’s now add another point mass m to the
previous example. Let it travel in the same circle, at the diametrically opposite point,
as shown in Fig. 9.12. Using ω = (0, 0, ω3), x2 + y2 = r2, and z = z0 in Eq. (9.8),
you can show that the angular momentum with respect to the origin is

L = 2mω3(0, 0, r2).

(9.13)

Since v = ω3r, the z component is 2mrv, as it should be. And L1 and L2 are zero,
unlike in the previous example, because these components of the L’s of the two
particles cancel. This occurs because of the symmetry of the masses around the z
axis, which causes the Izx and Izy entries in the inertia tensor to vanish; they are each
the sum of two terms, with opposite x values, or opposite y values. Alternatively, you
can just note that adding on the mirror-image L vector in Fig. 9.10 produces canceling
x and y components.

Let’s now look at the kinetic energy of our object, which is rotating around an
axis passing through the origin. To find this, we must add up the kinetic energies
of all the little pieces. A little piece has energy (dm) v2/2 = dm |ω × r|2/2.
Therefore, using Eq. (9.6), the total kinetic energy is

9.2.2 General motion

How do we deal with general motion in space? That is, what if an object is both
translating and rotating? For the motion in Fig. 9.13, the various pieces of mass
aren’t traveling in circles around the origin, so we can’t write v = ω × r, as we
did prior to Eq. (9.4).

To determine L (relative to the origin), and also the kinetic energy T , we will
use Theorem 9.1 to write the motion as the sum of a translation plus a rotation.
In applying the theorem, we may choose any point in the body to be the point
P in the theorem. However, only in the case where P is the object’s CM can we
extract anything useful, as we’ll see. The theorem then says that the motion of

9.2 The inertia tensor

381

the body is the sum of the motion of the CM plus a rotation around the CM. So
let the CM move with velocity V, and let the body instantaneously rotate with
angular velocity ω(cid:16) around the CM (that is, with respect to the frame whose origin
is the CM, and whose axes are parallel to the fixed-frame axes).4

Let the position of the CM relative to the origin be R = (X, Y, Z), and let
the position of a given piece of mass relative to the CM be r(cid:16) = (x(cid:16), y(cid:16), z(cid:16)). Then
r = R + r(cid:16) is the position of a piece of mass relative to the origin (see Fig. 9.14).
Let the velocity of a piece of mass relative to the CM be v(cid:16) (so v(cid:16) = ω(cid:16) × r(cid:16)).
Then v = V + v(cid:16) is the velocity relative to the origin.
Let’s look at L first. The angular momentum is

LCM is the angular momentum relative to the CM.5

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

We see that as in the pancake case in Section 8.1.2, the angular momentum
(relative to the origin) of a body can be found by treating the body like a point
mass located at the CM and finding the angular momentum of this point mass
relative to the origin, and by then adding on the angular momentum of the body
relative to the CM. Note that these two parts of the angular momentum need not
point in the same direction, as they did in the case of the pancake moving in the
x-y plane.

Now let’s look at T . The kinetic energy is

the other CM quantities below.

CM, and whose axes are parallel to the fixed-frame axes.

(cid:17)
V · (ω(cid:16) × r(cid:16)) dm vanishes because the integrand is linear in r(cid:16)
and thus yields a zero integral, by definition of the CM. As in the pancake case
in Section 8.1.2, the kinetic energy of a body can be found by treating the body
like a point mass located at the CM, and by then adding on the kinetic energy of
the body due to the rotation around the CM.

9.2.3 The parallel-axis theorem

y

Consider the special case where the CM rotates around the origin with the same
angular velocity at which the body rotates around the CM (see Fig. 9.15), that is,
V = ω(cid:16) × R. This can be achieved, for example, by piercing the body with the
base of a rigid “T” and then rotating the T and the body around the (fixed) line of
the “upper” part of the T (the origin must pass through this line). We then have the
nice situation where all points in the body travel in fixed circles around the axis
of rotation. Mathematically, this follows from v = V + v(cid:16) = ω(cid:16) × R + ω(cid:16) × r(cid:16) =
ω(cid:16) × r. Dropping the prime on ω, Eq. (9.16) becomes

This is the generalized parallel-axis theorem. It says that once you’ve calculated
ICM relative to the CM, then if you want to calculate I relative to another point,
you simply have to add on the IR matrix, obtained by treating the object like a
point mass at the CM. So you have to compute six extra numbers (there are six,
instead of nine, because the IR matrix is symmetric) instead of just the one MR2
in the parallel-axis theorem in Chapter 8, given in Eq. (8.13). Problem 9.4 gives
another derivation of the parallel-axis theorem, without mentioning the angular
velocity.

Remark: The name “parallel-axis” theorem is actually a misnomer here. The inertia tensor
isn’t associated with one particular axis, as the moment of inertia in Chapter 8 was. The moment
of inertia is just one of the diagonal entries (associated with a given axis) in the inertia tensor.
The inertia tensor depends on the entire coordinate system. So in that sense we should call this

9.3 Principal axes

the “parallel-axes” theorem, because the coordinate axes in the CM frame are assumed to be
parallel to the ones in the fixed frame. At any rate, the point is that the parallel-axis theorem
in Chapter 8 dealt with shifting the axis, whereas the present theorem deals with shifting the
origin (and hence all three axes in general). ♣

As far as the kinetic energy goes, if ω and ω(cid:16) are equal, so that V = ω(cid:16) × R,

9.3 Principal axes

The cumbersome expressions in the previous section may seem a bit unsettling,
but it turns out that usually we can get by without them. The strategy for avoiding
all of the above mess is to use the principal axes of a body, which we will define
below.

In general, the inertia tensor I in Eq. (9.8) has nine nonzero entries, of which
six are independent due to the symmetry of I. In addition to depending on the
origin chosen, the inertia tensor depends on the set of orthonormal basis vectors
chosen for the coordinate system; the x, y, z variables in the integrals in I depend,
of course, on the coordinate system they’re measured with respect to. Given a
blob of material, and given an arbitrary origin,6 any orthonormal set of basis
vectors is usable, but there is one special set that makes all our calculations
very nice. These special basis vectors are called the principal axes. They can be
defined in various equivalent ways:

• The principal axes are the orthonormal basis vectors for which I is diagonal, that is,

for which7

(9.22)

I1, I2, and I3 are called the principal moments. For many objects, it is quite obvious
what the principal axes are. For example, consider a uniform rectangle in the x-y plane.
Pick the origin to be the CM, and let the x and y axes be parallel to the sides. Then the

6 The CM is often chosen to be the origin, but it need not be. There are principal axes associated

with any origin.

7 Technically, we should be writing I11 or Ixx instead of I1, etc., in this matrix, because the one-
index object I1 looks like the component of a vector, not a matrix. But the two-index notation gets
cumbersome, so we’ll be sloppy and just use I1, etc.

384

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

principal axes are clearly the x, y, and z axes, because all the off-diagonal elements
in the inertia tensor in Eq. (9.8) vanish, by symmetry. For example, Ixy ≡ −
xy dm
equals zero, because for every point (x, y) in the rectangle, there is a corresponding point
(−x, y), so the contributions to
xy dm cancel in pairs. Also, the integrals involving z
are identically zero, because z = 0.

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

• A principal axis is an axis ˆω for which I ˆω = I ˆω. That is, a principal axis is a special
direction with the property that if ω points along it, then so does L. The principal axes
of an object are then the orthonormal set of three vectors ˆω1, ˆω2, ˆω3 with the property
that

I ˆω1 = I1 ˆω1,

I ˆω2 = I2 ˆω2,

I ˆω3 = I3 ˆω3.

(9.23)

The three statements in Eq. (9.23) are equivalent to Eq. (9.22), because the vectors ˆω1,
ˆω2, and ˆω3 are simply (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1) in the frame in which they are the
basis vectors.

• Consider an object rotating around a fixed axis with constant angular speed. Then this
axis is a principal axis if there is no need for any torque. So in some sense, the object is
“happy” to spin around a principal axis. A set of three orthonormal axes, each of which
has this property, is by definition what we call a set of principal axes.

This definition of a principal axis is equivalent to the previous definition for the
following reason. Assume that the object rotates around a fixed axis ˆω1 for which
L = I ˆω1 = I1 ˆω1, as in Eq. (9.23). Then since ˆω1 is assumed to be fixed, we see that L
is also fixed. Therefore, τ = dL/dt = 0.

Conversely, if the object is rotating around a fixed axis ˆω1, and if τ = dL/dt = 0,
then we claim that L points along ˆω1 (that is, L = I1 ˆω1). This is true because if L does
not point along ˆω1, then imagine painting a dot on the object somewhere along the line
of L. A little while later, the dot will have rotated around the fixed vector ˆω1. But the
line of L must always pass through the dot, because we could have rotated our axes
around ˆω1 and started the process at a slightly later time (this argument relies on ˆω1
being fixed). Therefore, we see that L has changed, in contradiction to the assumption
that dL/dt = 0. Hence, L must in fact point along ˆω1.

For a rotation around a principal axis ˆω, the lack of need for any torque means that
if the object is pivoted at the origin, and if the origin is the only place where any
force is applied (which implies that there is zero torque around it), then the object can
undergo rotation with constant angular velocity ω. If you try to set up this scenario with
a nonprincipal axis, it won’t work.

Example (Square with origin at corner): Consider the uniform square in
Fig. 9.16. In Appendix E, we show that the principal axes are the dotted lines drawn
(and also the z axis perpendicular to the page). But there is no need to use the tech-
niques in the appendix to see this, because in this new basis it is clear by symmetry
x1x2 is zero; for every x1 in the integral, there is a −x1. And x3 ≡ z
that the integral

(cid:17)

y

9.3 Principal axes

385

is identically zero, which makes all the other off-diagonal terms in I also equal to
zero. Therefore, since I is diagonal in this new basis, these basis vectors are the
principal axes.

Furthermore, it is intuitively clear that the square will be happy to rotate around
any one of these axes indefinitely. During such a rotation, the pivot will certainly be
applying a force (if the axis is ˆω1 or ˆz, but not if it is ˆω2), to produce the centripetal
acceleration of the CM in its circular motion. But it won’t be applying a torque relative
to the origin (because the r in r × F is 0). This is good, because for a rotation around
one of these principal axes, dL/dt = 0, so there is no need for any torque.
(cid:17)
In contrast with the off-diagonal zeros in the new basis, the integral

xy in the
old basis is not zero, because every point gives a positive contribution. So the inertia
tensor is not diagonal in the old basis, which means that ˆx and ˆy are not principal axes.
Consistent with this, it is reasonably clear that it is impossible to make the square
rotate around, say, the x axis, assuming that its only contact with the outside world
is through a pivot (for example, a ball and socket) at the origin. The square simply
doesn’t want to remain in this circular motion. Mathematically, L (relative to the
origin) doesn’t point along the x axis, so it therefore precesses around the x axis along
with the square, tracing out the surface of a cone. This means that L is changing. But
there is no torque available (relative to the origin) to provide for this change in L.
Hence, such a rotation cannot exist.

At the moment, it is not at all obvious that an orthonormal set of principal axes
exists for an arbitrary object. But this is indeed the case, as stated in Theorem 9.4
below. Assuming for now that principal axes do exist, then in this basis the L and
T in Eqs. (9.8) and (9.15) take on the particularly nice forms,

L = (I1ω1, I2ω2, I3ω3),
T = 1

+ I2ω2

(9.24)

The quantities ω1, ω2, and ω3 here are the components of a general vector ω
written in the principal-axis basis; that is, ω = ω1 ˆω1 + ω2 ˆω2 + ω3 ˆω3. Equation
(9.24) is a vast simplification over the general formulas in Eqs. (9.8) and (9.15).
We will therefore invariably work with principal axes in the remainder of this
chapter.

Note that the directions of the principal axes (relative to the body) depend only
on the geometry of the body. They may therefore be considered to be painted on
(or in) it. Hence, they will generally move around in space as the body rotates.
For example, if the object is rotating around a principal axis, then that axis
stays fixed while the other two principal axes rotate around it. In relations like
ω = (ω1, ω2, ω3) and L = (I1ω1, I2ω2, I3ω3), the components ωi and Iiωi are
measured along the instantaneous principal axes ˆωi. Since these axes change
with time, it is quite possible that the components ωi and Iiωi change with time,
as we’ll see in Section 9.5 (and onward).

386

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

Let’s now state the theorem that implies that a set of principal axes does indeed
exist for any body and any origin. The proof of this theorem involves a useful
but rather slick technique, but it’s slightly off the main line of thought, so we’ll
relegate it to Appendix D. Take a look at the proof if you wish, but if you want
to just accept the fact that principal axes exist, that’s fine.

Theorem 9.4 Given a real symmetric 3 × 3 matrix, I,
there exist three
orthonormal real vectors, ˆωk , and three real numbers, Ik , with the property
that

Proof: See Appendix D.

I ˆωk = Ik ˆωk .

(9.25)

(cid:1)

Since the inertia tensor in Eq. (9.8) is indeed symmetric for any body and any
origin, this theorem says that we can always find three orthogonal basis vectors
that satisfy Eq. (9.23). Or equivalently, we can always find three orthogonal basis
vectors for which I is a diagonal matrix, as in Eq. (9.22). In other words, principal
axes always exist. Problem 9.7 gives another way to demonstrate the existence
of principal axes in the special case of a pancake object.

Invariably, it is best to work in a coordinate system that has principal axes as
its basis, due to the simplicity of Eq. (9.24). And as mentioned in Footnote 6, the
origin is generally chosen to be the CM, because from Section 8.4.3 the CM is
one of the origins for which τ = dL/dt is a valid statement. But this choice is
not necessary; there are principal axes associated with any origin.

For an object with a fair amount of symmetry, the principal axes are usually
the obvious choices and can be written down by simply looking at the object
(examples are given below). If, however, you are given an unsymmetrical body,
then the only way to determine the principal axes is to pick an arbitrary basis,
then find I in this basis, and then go through a diagonalization procedure. This
diagonalization procedure basically consists of the steps at the beginning of the
proof of Theorem 9.4 (given in Appendix D), with the addition of one more step
to get the actual vectors, so we’ll relegate it to Appendix E. There’s no need
to worry much about this method. Virtually every system you encounter will
involve an object with sufficient symmetry to enable you to just write down the
principal axes.

Let’s now prove two very useful (and very similar) theorems.

Theorem 9.5 If two principal moments are equal (I1 = I2 ≡ I ), then any axis
(through the chosen origin) in the plane of the corresponding principal axes is a
principal axis, and its moment is also I . Similarly, if all three principal moments
are equal (I1 = I2 = I3 ≡ I ), then any axis (through the chosen origin) in space
is a principal axis, and its moment is also I .

Proof: The first part was already proved at the end of the proof in Appendix D,
but we’ll do it again here. Since I1 = I2 ≡ I , we have Iu1 = I u1, and Iu2 = I u2,

9.3 Principal axes

387

where the u’s are the principal axes. Hence, I(au1 + bu2) = I (au1 + bu2), for
any a and b. Therefore, any linear combination of u1 and u2 (that is, any vector
in the plane spanned by u1 and u2) is a solution to Iu = I u and is thus a principal
axis, by definition.

The proof of the second part proceeds in a similar manner. Since I1 = I2 =
I3 ≡ I , we have Iu1 = I u1, Iu2 = I u2, and Iu3 = I u3. Hence, I(au1 + bu2 +
cu3) = I (au1 + bu2 + cu3). Therefore, any linear combination of u1, u2, and u3
(that is, any vector in space) is a solution to Iu = I u and is thus a principal axis,
by definition.

In short, if I1 = I2 ≡ I , then I is the identity matrix (up to a multiple) in the
space spanned by u1 and u2. And if I1 = I2 = I3 ≡ I , then I is the identity matrix
(up to a multiple) in the entire space. Note that it isn’t required that the various
(cid:1)
ui vectors be orthogonal. All we need is that they span the relevant space.

If two or three moments are equal, so that there is freedom in choosing the
principal axes, then it is possible to pick a nonorthogonal group of them. We
will, however, always choose ones that are orthogonal. So when we say “a set of
principal axes,” we mean an orthonormal set.

Theorem 9.6 If a pancake object is symmetric under a rotation through an
angle θ (cid:13)= 180◦ in the x-y plane (such as a hexagon), then every axis in the
x-y plane (with the origin chosen to be the center of the symmetry rotation) is a
principal axis with the same moment.

Proof: Let ˆω0 be a principal axis in the plane, and let ˆωθ be the axis obtained
by rotating ˆω0 through the angle θ. Then ˆωθ is also a principal axis with the same
principal moment, due to the symmetry of the object. Therefore, I ˆω0 = I ˆω0, and
I ˆωθ = I ˆωθ .

Now, any vector ω in the x-y plane can be written as a linear combination of
ˆω0 and ˆωθ , provided that θ (cid:13)= 180◦ (or zero, of course). That is, ˆω0 and ˆωθ span
the x-y plane. Therefore, any vector ω can be written as ω = a ˆω0 + b ˆωθ , and so

Iω = I(a ˆω0 + b ˆωθ ) = aI ˆω0 + bI ˆωθ = I ω.

(9.26)

Hence, ω is also a principal axis. Problem 9.8 gives another proof of this
(cid:1)
theorem.

The theorem actually holds even without the “pancake” restriction. That is,
it holds for any object with a rotational symmetry around the z axis (excluding
θ (cid:13)= 180◦). This can be seen as follows. The z axis is a principal axis, because
if ω points along ˆz, then L must also point along ˆz, by symmetry. There are
therefore (at least) two principal axes in the x-y plane. Label one of these as ˆω0
and proceed as above.

Let’s now do some quick examples. We’ll state the principal axes for the
objects listed below (relative to the origin). Your task is to show that they

388

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

are correct. Usually, a quick symmetry argument shows that

is diagonal. In all of these examples (see Fig. 9.17), the origin for the principal
axes is understood to be the origin of the given coordinate system (which is not
necessarily the CM). In describing the axes, they therefore all pass through the
origin, in addition to having the other properties stated.

Example 1: Point mass at the origin.
principal axes: any axes.

Example 2: Point mass at the point (x0, y0, z0).
principal axes: axis through point, any axes perpendicular to this.

Example 3: Rectangle centered at the origin, as shown.

Example 4: Cylinder with axis as z axis.
principal axes: z axis, any axes in x-y plane.

Example 5: Square with one corner at origin, as shown.
principal axes: z axis, axis through CM, axis perpendicular to this.

9.4 Two basic types of problems

The previous three sections introduced a variety of abstract concepts. We will
now finally look at some actual physical systems. The concept of principal axes
gives us the ability to solve many kinds of problems. Two kinds, however, come
up again and again. There are variations on these, of course, but they may be
generally stated as follows.

• Strike a rigid object with an impulsive (that is, quick) blow. What is the motion of the

object immediately after the blow?

• An object rotates around a fixed axis. A given torque is applied. What is the frequency

of the rotation? Or conversely, given the frequency, what is the required torque?

We’ll work through an example for each of these problems. In both cases, the
solution involves a few standard steps, so we’ll write them out explicitly.

9.4.1 Motion after an impulsive blow

Problem: Consider the rigid object in Fig. 9.18. Three masses are connected
by three massless rods, in the shape of an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse
length 4a. The mass at the right angle is 2m, and the other two masses are m.
Label them A, B, C, as shown. Assume that the object is floating freely in outer
space. Mass B is struck with a quick blow, directed into the page. Let the imparted
F dt = P. (See Section 8.6 for a discussion of impulse
impulse have magnitude
and angular impulse.) What are the velocities of the three masses immediately
after the blow?

(cid:17)

Solution: Our strategy will be to find the angular momentum of the system
(relative to the CM) using the angular impulse, and then calculate the principal
moments and find the angular velocity vector (which will give the velocities
relative to the CM), and then finally add on the CM motion.

The altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse has length 2a, and the CM
is easily seen to be located at its midpoint (see Fig. 9.19). Picking the CM as our
origin, and letting the plane of the paper be the x-y plane, the positions of the
three masses are rA = (−2a, −a, 0), rB = (2a, −a, 0), and rC = (0, a, 0). There
are now five standard steps that we must perform.

• Find L: The positive z axis is directed out of the page, so the impulse vector is
F dt = (0, 0, −P). Therefore, the angular momentum of the system (relative to

(cid:17)

P ≡
the CM) is

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

L =

τ dt =

(rB × F) dt = rB ×

F dt

= (2a, −a, 0) × (0, 0, −P) = aP(1, 2, 0),

(9.28)

as shown in Fig. 9.19. We have used the fact that rB is essentially constant during the
blow (because the blow is assumed to happen very quickly) in taking rB outside the
integral.

• Calculate the principal moments: The principal axes are the x, y, and z axes, because
the symmetry of the triangle makes I diagonal in this basis, as you can quickly check.
The moments (relative to the CM) are

Ix = ma2 + ma2 + (2m)a2 = 4ma2,
Iy = m(2a)2 + m(2a)2 + (2m)02 = 8ma2,
Iz = Ix + Iy = 12ma2.

(9.29)

We have used the perpendicular-axis theorem to obtain Iz, although it won’t be needed
to solve the problem.

• Find ω: We now have two expressions for the angular momentum of the system. One
expression is in terms of the given impulse, Eq. (9.28). The other is in terms of the

390

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

moments and the angular velocity components, Eq. (9.24). Equating these gives

(Ixωx, Iyωy, Izωz) = aP(1, 2, 0)
=⇒ (4ma2ωx, 8ma2ωy, 12ma2ωz) = aP(1, 2, 0)

=⇒ (ωx, ωy, ωz) = P
4ma

(1, 1, 0),

(9.30)

as shown in Fig. 9.19.

• Calculate the velocities relative to the CM: Right after the blow, the object rotates
around the CM with the angular velocity found in Eq. (9.30). The velocities relative to
the CM are then ui = ω × ri. Thus,

uA = ω × rA = P
4ma
uB = ω × rB = P
4ma
uC = ω × rC = P
4ma

(1, 1, 0) × (−2a, −a, 0) = (0, 0, P/4m),

(1, 1, 0) × (2a, −a, 0) = (0, 0, −3P/4m),

(9.31)

(1, 1, 0) × (0, a, 0) = (0, 0, P/4m).

As a check, it makes sense that uB is three times as large as uA and uC , because B is
three times as far from the axis of rotation as A and C are, as you can verify by doing a
little geometry in Fig. 9.19.

• Add on the velocity of the CM: The impulse (that is, the change in linear momentum)
supplied to the whole system is P = (0, 0, −P). The total mass of the system is M = 4m.
Therefore, the velocity of the CM is

VCM = P
M

= (0, 0, −P/4m).

The total velocities of the masses are therefore

vA = uA + VCM = (0, 0, 0),
vB = uB + VCM = (0, 0, −P/m),
vC = uC + VCM = (0, 0, 0).

(9.32)

(9.33)

Remarks:

1. We see that masses A and C are instantaneously at rest immediately after the blow, and
mass B acquires all of the imparted impulse. In retrospect, this is clear. Basically, it is
possible for both A and C to remain at rest while B moves a tiny bit, so this is what
happens. If B moves into the page by a small distance (cid:9), then A and C won’t know that B
has moved, because their distances to B will change (assuming hypothetically that they
don’t move) by a distance of order only (cid:9)2. If we changed the problem and added a mass
D at, say, the midpoint of the hypotenuse, then it would not be possible for A, C, and D
to remain at rest while B moved a tiny bit. So there would have to be some other motion
in addition to B’s. This setup is the topic of Exercise 9.38.

2. As time goes on, the system undergoes a rather complicated motion. What happens
is that the CM moves with constant velocity while the masses rotate around it in

9.4 Two basic types of problems

391

a messy manner. Since there are no torques acting on the system (after the initial
blow), we know that L forever remains constant. It turns out that ω moves around
L while the masses rotate around this changing ω. These matters are the subject of
Section 9.6, although in that discussion we restrict ourselves to symmetric tops, that
is, ones with two equal moments. But these issues aside,
it’s good to know that
we can, without too much difficulty, determine what’s going on immediately after
the blow.

3. The object in this problem was assumed to be floating freely in space. If we instead have
an object that is pivoted at a given fixed point, then we should use this pivot as our origin.
There is then no need to perform the last step of adding on the velocity of the origin (which
was the CM, above), because this velocity is now zero. Equivalently, just consider the
pivot to be an infinite mass, which is therefore the location of the (motionless) CM. ♣

9.4.2 Frequency of motion due to a torque
Problem: Consider a stick of length (cid:2), mass m, and uniform mass density. The
stick is pivoted at its top end and swings around the vertical axis. Assume that
conditions have been set up so that the stick always makes an angle θ with the
vertical, as shown in Fig. 9.20. What is the frequency, ω, of this motion?

Solution: Our strategy will be to find the principal moments and then the
angular momentum of the system (in terms of ω), and then find the rate of
change of L, and then calculate the torque and equate it with dL/dt. We will
choose the pivot to be the origin.8 Again, there are five standard steps that we
must perform.

• Calculate the principal moments: The principal axes are the axis along the stick,
along with any two orthogonal axes perpendicular to the stick. So let the x and y axes
be as shown in Fig. 9.21. The positive z axis then points out of the page. The moments
(relative to the pivot) are Ix = m(cid:2)2/3, Iy = 0, and Iz = m(cid:2)2/3 (which won’t be needed).
• Find L: The angular velocity vector points vertically (however, see the third remark
following this solution), so in the basis of the principal axes, the angular velocity vector
is ω = (ω sin θ, ω cos θ , 0), where ω is yet to be determined. The angular momentum
of the system (relative to the pivot) is therefore

the instant shown in Fig. 9.21), with magnitude L = (1/3)m(cid:2)2ω sin θ. As the stick
rotates around the vertical axis, L traces out the surface of a cone. That is, the tip of L
traces out a horizontal circle. The radius of this circle is the horizontal component of
L, which is L cos θ . The speed of the tip (which is the magnitude of dL/dt) is therefore

8 This is a better choice than the CM because this way we won’t have to worry about any messy
forces acting at the pivot when computing the torque. The task of Exercise 9.41 is to work through
the more complicated solution which has the CM as the origin.

Remark: With more complicated objects where Iy (cid:13)= 0, L won’t point nicely along a
principal axis, so the length of its horizontal component (the radius of the circle that L
traces out) won’t immediately be obvious. In this case, you can either explicitly calculate
the horizontal component (see the spinning-top example in Section 9.7.5), or you can just do
things the formal way by finding the rate of change of L via the expression dL/dt = ω × L,
which holds for all the same reasons that v ≡ dr/dt = ω × r holds. In the present problem,
we obtain

into the page. Note that we calculated this cross product in the principal-axis basis. Although
these axes are changing in time, they present a perfectly good set of basis vectors at any
instant. ♣

• Calculate the torque: The torque (relative to the pivot) is due to gravity, which

effectively acts on the CM of the stick. So τ = r × F has magnitude

τ = rF sin θ = ((cid:2)/2)(mg) sin θ,

and it points into the page.

• Equate τ with dL/dt: The vectors dL/dt and τ both point into the page, which is
good, because they had better point in the same direction. Equating their magnitudes

1. This frequency is slightly larger than the frequency that would arise if we instead had a
mass on the end of a massless stick of length (cid:2). From Problem 9.12, the frequency in that

case is
the end of a massless stick of length 2(cid:2)/3, as far as these rotations are concerned.
√

2. As θ → π/2, the frequency goes to ∞, which makes sense. And as θ → 0, it approaches

3g/2(cid:2), which isn’t so obvious.

3. As explained in Problem 9.1, the instantaneous ω is not uniquely defined in some situa-
tions. At the instant shown in Fig. 9.20, the stick is moving directly into the page. What if
someone else wants to think of the stick as (instantaneously) rotating around the ω(cid:16) axis
perpendicular to the stick (the x axis, in the above notation), instead of the vertical axis,
as shown in Fig. 9.22. What is the angular speed ω(cid:16)?

Well, if ω is the angular speed of the stick around the vertical axis, then we may view
the tip of the stick as instantaneously moving in a circle of radius (cid:2) sin θ around the

9.5 Euler’s equations

393

vertical axis ω. So ω((cid:2) sin θ) is the speed of the tip of the stick. But we may also view
the tip of the stick as instantaneously moving in a circle of radius (cid:2) around ω(cid:16), as shown.
The speed of the tip is still ω((cid:2) sin θ), so the angular speed around this axis is given by
ω(cid:16)(cid:2) = ω((cid:2) sin θ). Hence ω(cid:16) = ω sin θ, which is simply the x component of ω that we
found above, right before Eq. (9.34). The moment of inertia around ω(cid:16) is m(cid:2)2/3, so the
angular momentum has magnitude (m(cid:2)2/3)(ω sin θ), in agreement with Eq. (9.34). And
the direction is along the x axis, as it should be.

Note that although ω is not uniquely defined at any instant, L ≡

(r × p) dm certainly
is.9 Choosing ω to point vertically, as we did in the above solution, is in some sense the
natural choice, because this ω doesn’t change with time. ♣

(cid:17)

9.5 Euler’s equations
Consider a rigid body instantaneously rotating around an axis ω. This ω may
change as time goes on, but all we care about for now is what it is at a given
instant. The angular momentum is given by Eq. (9.8) as L = Iω, where I is the
inertia tensor, calculated with respect to a given origin and a given set of axes
(and ω is written in the same basis, of course).

As usual, things are much nicer if we use the principal axes (relative to the
chosen origin) as the basis vectors of our coordinate system. Since these axes are
fixed with respect to the rotating object, they will rotate with respect to the fixed
reference frame. In this basis, L takes the nice form,

L = (I1ω1, I2ω2, I3ω3),

(9.39)

where ω1, ω2, and ω3 are the components of ω along the principal axes. In other
words, if you take the vector L in space and project it onto the instantaneous
principal axes, then you get the components in Eq. (9.39).

On one hand, writing L in terms of the rotating principal axes allows us to
write it in the nice form of Eq. (9.39). But on the other hand, writing L in this
way makes it nontrivial to determine how it changes in time, because the principal
axes themselves are changing. However, it turns out that the benefits outweigh
the detriments, so we will invariably use the principal axes as our basis vectors.
The goal of this section is to find an expression for dL/dt, and to then equate

this with the torque. The result will be Euler’s equations in Eq. (9.45).

Derivation of Euler’s equations
If we write L in terms of the body frame, which we’ll choose to be described
by the principal axes painted on the body, then L can change (relative to the lab
frame) due to two effects. It can change because its coordinates in the body frame
change, and it can also change because of the rotation of the body frame. To be
precise, let L0 be the vector L at a given instant. At this instant, imagine painting
the vector L0 onto the body frame, so that L0 then rotates with the body. The rate

9 The nonuniqueness of ω arises from the fact that Iy = 0 here. If all the moments are nonzero, then

(Lx, Ly, Lz) = (Ixωx, Iyωy, Izωz) uniquely determines ω, given L.

394

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

of change of L with respect to the lab frame may be written in the (identically
true) way,

dL
dt

= d(L − L0)
dt

+ dL0
dt

.

(9.40)

The second term here is simply the rate of change of a body-fixed vector, which
we know is ω × L0, which equals ω × L at this instant. The first term is the rate
of change of L with respect to the body frame, which we’ll denote by δL/δt.
This is what someone standing fixed on the body measures. So we end up with

dL
dt

=

δL
δt

+ ω × L.

(9.41)

This is actually a general statement, true for any vector in any rotating frame
(we’ll derive it in another more mathematical way in Chapter 10). There was
nothing particular about L that we used in the above derivation. Also, there was
no need to restrict ourselves to principal axes. In words, what we’ve shown is
that the total change equals the change relative to the rotating frame, plus the
change of the rotating frame relative to the fixed frame. This is just the usual way
of adding velocities when one frame moves with respect to another.

Let us now make use of our choice of the principal axes as the body axes.
This will put Eq. (9.41) in a usable form. Using Eq. (9.39), we can rewrite
Eq. (9.41) as

dL
dt

= d
dt

(I1ω1, I2ω2, I3ω3) + (ω1, ω2, ω3) × (I1ω1, I2ω2, I3ω3).

(9.42)

The δL/δt term does indeed equal (d/dt)(I1ω1, I2ω2, I3ω3), because someone
in the body frame measures the components of L with respect to the principal
axes to be (I1ω1, I2ω2, I3ω3). And δL/δt is by definition the rate at which these
components change.

Equation (9.42) equates two vectors. As is true for any vector, these (equal)
vectors have an existence that is independent of the coordinate system we choose
to describe them with (Eq. (9.41) makes no reference to a coordinate system).
But since we’ve chosen an explicit frame on the right-hand side of Eq. (9.42),
we should choose the same frame for the left-hand side. We can then equate the
components on the left with the components on the right. Projecting dL/dt onto
the instantaneous principal axes, we have

Remark: The left-hand side looks nastier than it really is. The reason we’ve written it in
this cumbersome way is the following (this is a remark that has to be read very slowly). We

9.5 Euler’s equations

395

could have written the left-hand side as (d/dt)(L1, L2, L3), but this might cause confusion as to
whether the Li refer to the components with respect to the rotating axes, or the components with
respect to the fixed set of axes that coincide with the rotating principal axes at this instant. That
is, do we project L onto the principal axes to obtain components, and then take the derivative
of these components? Or do we take the derivative of L and then project onto the principal axes
to obtain components? The latter is what we mean in Eq. (9.43).10 The way we’ve written the
left-hand side of Eq. (9.43), it’s clear that we’re taking the derivative first. We are, after all,
simply projecting Eq. (9.41) onto the principal axes. ♣

The time derivatives on the right-hand side of Eq. (9.43) are d(I1ω1)/dt =
I1 ˙ω1, etc., because the I ’s are constant. Performing the cross product and equating
the corresponding components on each side yields the three equations,

= I2 ˙ω2 + (I1 − I3)ω1ω3,

(9.44)

= I3 ˙ω3 + (I2 − I1)ω2ω1.

We will now invoke the results of Section 8.4.3 to say that if we have chosen the
origin of our rotating frame to be either a fixed point or the CM (as we always
do), then we can equate dL/dt with the torque, τ. We therefore have

τ1 = I1 ˙ω1 + (I3 − I2)ω3ω2,
τ2 = I2 ˙ω2 + (I1 − I3)ω1ω3,
τ3 = I3 ˙ω3 + (I2 − I1)ω2ω1.

(9.45)

These are Euler’s equations. You need to remember only one of them, because
the other two can be obtained by cyclic permutation of the indices.

Remarks:

1. We repeat that the left- and right-hand sides of Eqs. (9.45) are components that are mea-
sured with respect to the instantaneous principal axes. Let’s say we do a problem, for
example, where τ3 has a constant nonzero value, and τ1 and τ2 are always zero (as in the
example in Section 9.4.2). This doesn’t mean that τ is a constant vector. On the contrary,
τ always points along the ˆx3 vector in the rotating frame, but this vector is changing in
the fixed frame (unless ˆx3 points along ω).

2. The two types of terms on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (9.44) are the two types of changes
that L can undergo. L can change because its components with respect to the rotating
frame change, and L can also change because the body is rotating around ω.

10 The former is δL/δt, by definition. The two interpretations certainly give different results. For
example, if instead of L we consider a vector fixed in the body (such as the L0 above), then
the first interpretation gives a zero result, whereas the second interpretation gives a nonzero
result. Considering what we mean by, say, the vector (ω1, ω2, ω3), I think that the more logical
interpretation of (d/dt)(L1, L2, L3) is the first one, so it should definitely be avoided.

3. Section 9.6.1 on the free symmetric top (viewed from the body frame) provides a good
example of the use of Euler’s equations. Another interesting application is the famed
“Tennis racket theorem” (Problem 9.14).

4. It should be noted that you never have to use Euler’s equations. You can simply start
from scratch and use Eq. (9.41) each time you solve a problem. The point is that
we’ve done the calculation of dL/dt once and for all, so you can just invoke the result
in Eqs. (9.45). ♣

9.6 Free symmetric top

The free symmetric top is the classic example of an application of Euler’s
equations. Consider an object that has two of its principal moments equal, with
the CM as the origin. Assume that the object is in outer space, far from any
external forces. We will choose the object to have cylindrical symmetry around
some axis (see Fig. 9.23), although this is not necessary; a square cross section,
for example, would yield two equal moments. The principal axes are then the
symmetry axis and any two orthogonal axes in the cross-section plane through
the CM. Let the symmetry axis be chosen as the ˆx3 axis. Then the moments are
I1 = I2 ≡ I , and I3.

We’ll first look at things from the point of view of someone standing at rest
on the body, and then we’ll look at things from the point of view of someone
standing at rest in an inertial frame. The mathematics involved here isn’t so bad,
but as with most types of top problems, it’s hard to get an intuitive feel for what
all the various vectors are doing. And the intuition is even more difficult in the
following body-frame analysis because of the noninertial frame of reference. But
let’s see what we find.

9.6.1 View from the body frame
Plugging I1 = I2 ≡ I into Euler’s equations in Eq. (9.45), and using the fact that
all the τi are zero (since there are no torques, because the top is “free”), we have
0 = I ˙ω1 + (I3 − I )ω3ω2,
0 = I ˙ω2 + (I − I3)ω1ω3,
0 = I3 ˙ω3.

(9.46)

The last equation says that ω3 is constant. If we then define

(cid:18) ≡

the first two equations become

(cid:2)

ω3,

˙ω1 + (cid:18)ω2 = 0,

and

˙ω2 − (cid:18)ω1 = 0.

(9.47)

(9.48)

Taking the derivative of the first of these, and then using the second to eliminate
˙ω2, gives

¨ω1 + (cid:18)2ω1 = 0,

and likewise for ω2. This is a good old simple-harmonic-oscillator equation.
We can therefore write ω1(t) as, say, a cosine. And then Eq. (9.48) yields a sine
for ω2(t). So we have

ω1(t) = A cos((cid:18)t + φ), ω2(t) = A sin((cid:18)t + φ).

(9.50)

We see that ω1(t) and ω2(t) are the components of a circle in the body frame.
Therefore, the ω vector traces out a cone around ˆx3 (see Fig. 9.24), with frequency
(cid:18), as viewed by someone standing on the body. This frequency (cid:18) in Eq. (9.47)
depends on the value of ω3 and on the geometry of the object (through I3 and I ).
But the radius, A, of the ω cone is determined by the initial values of ω1 and ω2.

The angular momentum is

(cid:7)

(cid:8)

L = (I1ω1, I2ω2, I3ω3) =

IA cos((cid:18)t + φ), IA sin((cid:18)t + φ), I3ω3

,

(9.51)

so L also traces out a cone around ˆx3 with frequency (cid:18), as viewed by someone
standing on the body. This is shown in Fig. 9.24 for the case (cid:18) > 0 (that is,
I3 > I ). In this case, I3 > I implies L3/L2 > ω3/ω2, so the L vector lies above
the ω vector (that is, between ω and ˆx3). An object with I3 > I , such as a coin,
is called an oblate top.

Figure 9.25 shows the case where (cid:18) < 0 (that is, I3 < I ). In this case, I3 < I
implies L3/L2 < ω3/ω2, so the L vector lies below the ω vector, as shown.
And since (cid:18) is negative, the ω and L vectors precess around ˆx3 in the opposite
direction (clockwise, as viewed from above). An object with I3 < I , such as a
carrot, is called a prolate top.

Example (The earth): Let’s consider the earth to be our top. Then ω3 ≈
2π/(1 day).11 The bulge at the equator (caused by the spinning of the earth) makes I3
slightly larger than I , and it turns out that (I3 − I )/I ≈ 1/320. Therefore, Eq. (9.47)
gives (cid:18) ≈ (1/320) 2π/(1 day). So the ω vector should precess around in its cone
once every 320 days, as viewed by someone on the earth. The true value is more like
430 days. The difference has to do with various things, including the nonrigidity of
the earth, but at least we got an answer in the right ballpark. This precession of ω is
known as the “Chandler wobble.”

In practice, how can we determine the direction of ω? Simply take an extended-
time photograph exposure at night. The stars will form arcs of circles. At the center
of all these circles is a point that doesn’t move. This is the direction of ω. Fortunately,
(cid:18) is much smaller than ω, so the ω vector doesn’t change much during an exposure
time of, say, an hour. So the center of the circles is essentially well defined.

How big is the ω cone, for the earth? Equivalently, what is the value of A in
Eq. (9.50)? Observation has shown that the ω vector pierces the earth at a point on

11 This isn’t quite correct, since the earth rotates 366 times for every 365 days, due to the motion

around the sun, but it’s close enough for the purposes here.

the order of 10 m from the north pole, although this distance fluctuates over time.12
Hence, A/ω3 ≈ (10 m)/RE. The half-angle of the ω cone is therefore on the order of
−4 degrees. So if you use an extended-time photograph exposure one night to
only 10
see which point in the sky stands still, and then if you do the same thing 200 nights
later, you probably won’t be able to tell that they’re really two different points.

9.6.2 View from a ﬁxed frame

Let’s now see what our symmetric top looks like from a fixed frame. Euler’s
equations won’t help much here, because they deal with the components of ω
in the body frame. But fortunately we can solve for the motion from scratch. In
terms of the (changing) principal axes, ˆx1, ˆx2, ˆx3, we have

ω = (ω1 ˆx1 + ω2 ˆx2) + ω3 ˆx3,
L = I (ω1 ˆx1 + ω2 ˆx2) + I3ω3 ˆx3.
Eliminating the (ω1 ˆx1 + ω2 ˆx2) term from these equations gives (in terms of the
(cid:18) defined in Eq. (9.47))

(9.52)

L = I (ω + (cid:18)ˆx3) =⇒ ω = L
I

ˆL − (cid:18)ˆx3,

(9.53)

)

where L = |L|, and ˆL is the unit vector in the L direction. The linear relationship
among L, ω, and ˆx3 implies that these three vectors lie in a plane. But L remains
fixed, because there are no torques on the system. Therefore, ω and ˆx3 precess (as
we’ll see below) around L, with the three vectors always coplanar. See Fig. 9.26
for the case (cid:18) > 0, that is, I3 > I (an oblate top), and Fig. 9.27 for the case
(cid:18) < 0, that is, I3 < I (a prolate top).

What is the frequency of this precession, as viewed from the fixed frame? The
rate of change of ˆx3 is ω × ˆx3, because ˆx3 is fixed in the body frame, so its change
comes only from rotation around ω. Therefore, Eq. (9.53) gives

d ˆx3

(9.54)

But this is simply the expression for the rate of change of a vector rotating
around the fixed vector ˜ω ≡ (L/I ) ˆL. The frequency of this rotation is | ˜ω| = L/I .
Therefore, ˆx3 precesses around the fixed vector L with frequency

12 This distance could theoretically be much larger or much smaller than 10 m. It happens to be of
this order due to the nature of the driving force. The present consensus for this force is pressure
changes at the bottom of the ocean and in the atmosphere; see Gross (2000). Without a driving
force, the amplitude would head to zero, due to the nonrigidity of the earth.

in the fixed frame. And therefore ω does also, because it is coplanar with
ˆx3 and L.

Remarks:

1. We just found that ω precesses around L with frequency L/I . What, then, is wrong with
the following reasoning: “Just as the rate of change of ˆx3 equals ω × ˆx3, the rate of change
of ω should equal ω × ω, which is zero. Therefore, ω should remain constant.” The error
is that the vector ω is not fixed in the body frame. A vector A must be fixed in the body
frame in order for its rate of change to be given by ω × A.

2. We found in Eqs. (9.51) and (9.47) that a person standing on the rotating body sees L (and
ω) precess with frequency (cid:18) ≡ ω3(I3 − I )/I around ˆx3. But we found in Eq. (9.55) that
a person standing in the fixed frame sees ˆx3 (and ω) precess with frequency L/I around
L. Are these two facts compatible? Should we have obtained the same frequency from
either point of view? (Answers: yes, no).

These two frequencies are indeed consistent, as can be seen by the following reasoning.
Consider the plane (call it S) containing the three vectors L, ω, and ˆx3. We know from
Eq. (9.51) that S rotates with frequency (cid:18)ˆx3 with respect to the body. Therefore, the
body rotates with frequency −(cid:18)ˆx3 with respect to S. And from Eq. (9.55), S rotates with
frequency (L/I ) ˆL with respect to the fixed frame. Therefore, the total angular velocity of
the body with respect to the fixed frame is (using the frame S as an intermediate step)

ωtotal = L
I

ˆL − (cid:18)ˆx3.

(9.56)

But from Eq. (9.53), this is simply ω, as it should be. So the two frequencies in Eqs. (9.47)
and (9.55) are indeed consistent.

For the earth, I3 and I are nearly the same, so (cid:18) ≡ ω3(I3 − I )/I and L/I are quite
different. L/I is roughly equal to L/I3, which is essentially equal to ω3. On the other hand,
(cid:18) is roughly equal to (1/300)ω3. Basically, an external observer sees ω precess around
its cone at roughly the rate at which the earth spins. But it’s not exactly the same rate, and
this difference is what causes the earth-based observer to see ω precess with a nonzero (cid:18).
ˆx3 around L should not be confused with the
the equinoxes” effect. See Problem 10.15 for a discussion of

3. The fixed-frame precession of

9.7 Heavy symmetric top

Consider now a heavy symmetrical top, that is, one that spins on a table, under
the influence of gravity (see Fig. 9.28). Assume that the tip of the top is fixed on
the table by a pivot. We’ll solve for the motion of the top in two different ways
below in Sections 9.7.3 and 9.7.4. The first uses τ = dL/dt, and the second uses
the Lagrangian method.

9.7.1 Euler angles
For both of these methods, it is convenient to use the Euler angles, θ, φ, ψ,
which are shown in Fig. 9.29 and defined as follows.

• θ: Let ˆx3 be the symmetry axis of the top. Define θ to be the angle that ˆx3 makes with

the vertical ˆz axis of the fixed frame.

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

• φ: Draw the plane orthogonal to ˆx3. Let ˆx1 be the intersection of this plane with the
horizontal x-y plane. Define φ to be the angle that ˆx1 makes with the ˆx axis in the fixed
frame. Note that ˆx1 is not necessarily fixed in the object.

• ψ: Let ˆx2 be orthogonal to ˆx3 and ˆx1, as shown. As with ˆx1, ˆx2 is not necessarily fixed
in the object. Let frame S be the frame whose axes are ˆx1, ˆx2, and ˆx3. Define ψ to be
the angle of rotation of the body around the ˆx3 axis in frame S. So ˙ψ ˆx3 is the angular
velocity of the body with respect to S. And from the figure, we also see that the angular
velocity of frame S with respect to the fixed frame is ˙φ ˆz + ˙θ ˆx1.

The angular velocity of the body with respect to the fixed frame is equal to the
angular velocity of the body with respect to frame S, plus the angular velocity of
frame S with respect to the fixed frame. From above, we therefore have

ω = ˙ψ ˆx3 + ( ˙φ ˆz + ˙θ ˆx1).

(9.57)

It is often more convenient to rewrite ω entirely in terms of the orthogonal ˆx1,
ˆx2, ˆx3 basis vectors. Since ˆz = cos θ ˆx3 + sin θ ˆx2, Eq. (9.57) gives

ω = ( ˙ψ + ˙φ cos θ)ˆx3 + ˙φ sin θ ˆx2 + ˙θ ˆx1.

(9.58)

This form of ω is generally more useful, because ˆx1, ˆx2, ˆx3 are principal axes of
the body. (We are assuming that we are working with a symmetrical top, with
I1 = I2 ≡ I . This means that any axes in the ˆx1-ˆx2 plane are principal axes.)
Although ˆx1 and ˆx2 are not fixed in the object, they are still good principal axes
at any instant.

9.7.2 Digression on the components of ω
The above expressions for ω might look a little scary, but there is a very helpful
diagram we can draw (see Fig. 9.30) that makes it easier to see what’s going on.
Let’s talk a bit about this before tackling the original problem of the spinning top.
The diagram is rather dense (you might even say it looks scarier than the above ω),
so we’ll go through it slowly. In the following discussion, we’ll simplify things
by setting ˙θ = 0. All the interesting features of ω remain. The ˙θ ˆx1 component of
ω in Eqs. (9.57) and (9.58) arises simply from the easily visualizable rising and
falling of the top. We will therefore concentrate on the more complicated issues,
namely the components of ω in the plane of ˆx3, ˆz, and ˆx2.

With ˙θ = 0, Fig. 9.30 shows the vector ω in the ˆx3-ˆz-ˆx2 plane (the way we’ve
drawn it, ˆx1 points into the page, in contrast with Fig. 9.29). We’ll refer to this
figure many times in the problems for this chapter. There are numerous comments
to be made about it, so we’ll just list them out. The following discussion deals
with the kinematics of ω, that is, the meaning of the various components and how
they relate to each other. The discussion of the dynamics of ω, that is, why the
components take on the values they do, given a certain physical system, is the
subject of Section 9.7.3 onward.

1. If someone asks you to “decompose” ω into pieces along ˆz and ˆx3, what would you
do? Would you draw the lines perpendicular to these axes to obtain the lengths shown
(which we’ll label as ωz and ω3), or would you draw the lines parallel to these axes to
obtain the lengths shown (which we’ll label as (cid:18) and ω(cid:16)
)? There is no “correct” answer
to this question. The four quantities, ωz, ω3, (cid:18), ω(cid:16)
simply represent different things.
We will interpret each of these below, along with ω2 (the projection of ω along ˆx2).
It turns out that (cid:18) and ω(cid:16)
are the frequencies that your eye can see the easiest, while
ω2 and ω3 are what you want to use when doing calculations involving the angular
momentum. But as far as I can see, ωz is not of much use.

2. Note that it is true that

ω = ω(cid:16) ˆx3 + (cid:18)ˆz,

but it is not true that ω = ω3 ˆx3 + ωz ˆz. Another true statement is

ω = ω3 ˆx3 + ω2 ˆx2.

(9.59)

(9.60)

3. In terms of the Euler angles, we see by comparing Eqs. (9.59) and (9.57), with ˙θ = 0,

that

ω(cid:16) = ˙ψ,

and (cid:18) = ˙φ.

And we also have, by comparing Eqs. (9.60) and (9.58), with ˙θ = 0,

ω3 = ˙ψ + ˙φ cos θ = ω(cid:16) + (cid:18) cos θ,
ω2 = ˙φ sin θ = (cid:18) sin θ .

(9.61)

(9.62)

These are also clear from Fig. 9.30. There is therefore technically no need to introduce
the new ω2, ω3, (cid:18), ω(cid:16)
definitions in Fig. 9.30, because the Euler angles are quite

402

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

sufficient. But we will be referring back to this figure many times, and it is a little
easier to work with these omegas than the various combinations of the Euler angles.
4. (cid:18) is the easiest of the frequencies to visualize. It is the frequency of precession of
the top around the vertical ˆz axis.13 In other words, the symmetry axis ˆx3 traces out a
cone (assuming ˙θ = 0) around the ˆz axis with frequency (cid:18). The reason for this is the
following. The vector ω is the vector that gives the speed of any point (at position r)
fixed in the top as ω × r. Therefore, since the vector ˆx3 is fixed in the top, we can write

d ˆx3
dt

= ω × ˆx3 = (ω(cid:16) ˆx3 + (cid:18)ˆz) × ˆx3 = ((cid:18)ˆz) × ˆx3.

(9.63)

But this is precisely the expression for the rate of change of a vector rotating around the
ˆz axis with frequency (cid:18). (This is exactly the same type of proof as the one leading to
Eq. (9.54).) Note that the precession frequency around the ˆz axis is not ωz. It certainly
can’t be ωz, because we can imagine grabbing the symmetry axis and holding it in
place, so that ω points along ˆx3. This scenario has a nonzero ωz, but no precession.
In the derivation of Eq. (9.63), we basically just stripped off the part of ω that
Remark:
points along the ˆx3 axis, because a rotation around ˆx3 contributes nothing to the motion
of ˆx3. Note, however, that there is in fact an infinite number of ways to strip off a piece
along ˆx3. For example, we can also break ω up as, say, ω = ω3 ˆx3 + ω2 ˆx2. We then obtain
d ˆx3/dt = (ω2 ˆx2) × ˆx3, which means that ˆx3 is instantaneously rotating around ˆx2 with
frequency ω2. Although this is true, it isn’t as useful as the result in Eq. (9.63), because the
ˆx2 axis changes with time (it precesses around ˆz). The point here is that the instantaneous
angular velocity vector around which the symmetry axis rotates is not well defined (Problem
9.1 discusses this issue).14 But the ˆz axis is the only one of these angular velocity vectors
that is fixed. When we look at the top (or more precisely, the symmetry axis), we therefore
see it precessing around the ˆz axis. ♣

5. ω(cid:16)

is also easy to visualize. Imagine that you are at rest in the frame that rotates around
the ˆz axis with frequency (cid:18). Then you see the symmetry axis of the top remain perfectly
still, and the only motion you see is the top spinning around this axis with frequency
. (This is true because ω = ω(cid:16) ˆx3 + (cid:18)ˆz, and the rotation of your frame causes you
ω(cid:16)
not to see the (cid:18)ˆz part.) If you paint a dot somewhere on the top, then the dot traces
out a fixed tilted circle, and the dot returns to, say, its maximum height at frequency
ω(cid:16)
. A person in the lab frame sees this dot undergo a rather complicated motion but
must observe the same frequency at which the dot returns to its highest point. So ω(cid:16)
is
something quite physical in the lab frame also.

6. ω3 is what you use to obtain the component of L along ˆx3, because L3 = I3ω3. ω3
, but it is the frequency with which the top

is a little harder to visualize than (cid:18) and ω(cid:16)

13 Although we’re using the same letter, this (cid:18) doesn’t have anything to do with the (cid:18) defined in
Eq. (9.47), except for the fact that they both represent the frequency of something precessing
around an axis.

14 The instantaneous angular velocity of the whole body is well defined, of course. There is a definite
line of points in the body that are instantaneously at rest. But if you look at the symmetry axis by
itself, then there is an ambiguity (see Footnote 9). In short, because only one point on the axis (the
bottom end), instead of a whole line, is instantaneously at rest, the instantaneous angular velocity
vector can point in any direction.

9.7 Heavy symmetric top

403

instantaneously rotates, as seen by someone at rest in the frame that rotates around the
instantaneous ˆx2 axis with frequency ω2. (This is true because ω = ω2 ˆx2 + ω3 ˆx3, and
the rotation of the frame causes the person not to see the ω2 ˆx2 part.) This rotation is
harder to vizualize in the lab frame, because the ˆx2 axis changes with time.

There is one physical scenario in which ω3 is the easily observed frequency. Imagine
that the top is precessing around the ˆz axis at constant θ (we’ll find in Section 9.7.5 that
this is in fact a possible motion for the top), and imagine that the top has a frictionless
rod protruding along its symmetry axis. If you grab the rod and stop the precession
motion, so that the top is now spinning around its stationary symmetry axis, then this
spinning has frequency ω3. This is true because when you grab the rod, your torque
has no component along the ˆx3 axis (because the rod lies along this axis, and because
it is frictionless). Therefore, L3 doesn’t change, and so neither does ω3.

7. ω2 is similar to ω3, of course. ω2 is what you use to obtain the component of L along ˆx2,
because L2 = I2ω2. It is the frequency with which the top instantaneously rotates, as
seen by someone at rest in the frame that rotates around the instantaneous ˆx3 axis with
frequency ω3. (This is true because ω = ω2 ˆx2 + ω3 ˆx3, and the rotation of the frame
causes the person not to see the ω3 ˆx3 part.) Again, this rotation is harder to vizualize in
the lab frame, because the ˆx3 axis changes with time. Note that by “instantaneous ˆx3
axis,” we mean the fixed axis in space that coincides with the symmetry axis at a given
instant. The symmetry axis will therefore move away from this fixed axis, consistent
with the fact that the person in the above-mentioned rotating frame sees the top rotate
around the ˆx2 axis.

The physical scenario that produces ω2, analogous to the scenario that produced ω3
above, is the following. Imagine a frictionless rod glued to the top at its tip, perpen-
dicular to the symmetry axis, so that they form a “T.” As this rod is spinning around
(ignore the fact that it has to keep passing through the table), grab it at the instant it
points along ˆx2. The top will then rotate with frequency ω2 around the fixed rod. This
is true for reasons analogous to the ones in the ω3 case above.

8. ωz is not very useful, as far as I can see. The most important thing to note about ωz
is that it is not the frequency of precession around the ˆz axis, even though it is the
projection of ω onto ˆz. The frequency of the precession is (cid:18), as we found above in
Eq. (9.63). A true, but somewhat useless, fact about ωz is that if someone is at rest
in the frame that rotates around the ˆz axis with frequency ωz, then she sees all points
in the top instantaneously rotating around the horizontal ˆx axis with frequency ωx,
where ωx is the projection of ω onto the ˆx axis. (This is true because ω = ωx ˆx + ωz ˆz,
and the rotation of the frame causes her not to see the ωz ˆz part.)

9.7.3 Torque method

Let’s now finally solve for the motion of a heavy top. This first method involving
torque is straightforward, although a bit tedious. We include it here to (1) show
that the problem can be done without resorting to a Lagrangian, and to (2) get
some practice using τ = dL/dt. We’ll make use of the form of ω given in

404

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

Eq. (9.58), because there it is broken up into the principal-axis components. For
convenience, define ˙β = ˙ψ + ˙φ cos θ, so that

ω = ˙β ˆx3 + ˙φ sin θ ˆx2 + ˙θ ˆx1.
Note that we’ve returned to the most general motion, where ˙θ is not necessarily
zero. For our origin, we’ll choose the tip of the top, which is assumed to be fixed
on the table.15 Let the principal moments relative to this origin be I1 = I2 ≡ I ,
and I3. The angular momentum of the top is then

(9.64)

L = I3

˙β ˆx3 + I ˙φ sin θ ˆx2 + I ˙θ ˆx1.

(9.65)

We must now calculate dL/dt. What makes this nontrivial is the fact that the ˆx1,
ˆx2, and ˆx3 unit vectors change with time (they change with θ and φ). But let’s
forge ahead and take the derivative of Eq. (9.65). Using the product rule (which
works fine with the product of a scalar and a vector), we have

dL

Using a little geometry, you can show that

= ˙θ ˆx3 − ˙φ cos θ ˆx1,

= − ˙φ sin θ ˆx3 + ˙φ cos θ ˆx2.

(9.66)

(9.67)

As an exercise, you should verify these by making use of Fig. 9.29. In the
first equation, for example, show that a change in θ causes ˆx3 to move a cer-
tain distance in the ˆx2 direction; and show that a change in φ causes ˆx3 to move
a certain distance in the ˆx1 direction. Plugging the derivative expressions from
Eq. (9.67) into Eq. (9.66) gives, after some algebra,

Let’s now look at the torque on the top. This arises from gravity pulling down
on the CM. So from Fig. 9.29, τ points in the ˆx1 direction and has magnitude

15 We could use the CM as our origin, but then we would have to include the complicated forces
acting at the pivot point, which is difficult. But see Problem 9.19 for the case where the tip is free
to slide on a frictionless table.

Mg(cid:2) sin θ, where (cid:2) is the distance from the pivot to the CM. Using Eq. (9.68),
the third component of τ = dL/dt quickly gives

¨β = 0.
(9.69)
Therefore, ˙β is a constant, which we’ll call ω3 (an obvious label, in view of
Eq. (9.64)). The other two components of τ = dL/dt then give

I ¨φ sin θ + ˙θ(2I ˙φ cos θ − I3ω3) = 0,
˙φ) sin θ = I ¨θ.

(Mg(cid:2) + I ˙φ2 cos θ − I3ω3

(9.70)

We’ll wait to fiddle with these equations until we have derived them again using
the Lagrangian method.

9.7.4 Lagrangian method
Equation (9.15) gives the kinetic energy of the top as T = ω · L/2. Using
Eqs. (9.64) and (9.65), we have (writing ˙ψ + ˙φ cos θ instead of the shorthand ˙β)16

T = 1

ω · L = 1

The potential energy is

V = Mg(cid:2) cos θ,

(9.72)

where (cid:2) is the distance from the pivot to the CM. The Lagrangian is L = T − V
(we’ll use “L” here to avoid confusion with the angular momentum “L”), and so
the equation of motion obtained from varying ψ is

∂L

Therefore, ˙ψ + ˙φ cos θ is a constant. Call it ω3. The equations of motion obtained

Taking the derivative in the first equation, we see that these equations are identical

16 It was ok to use β in the previous subsection. We introduced it only because it was quicker to write.
But we can’t use it here, because it depends on the other coordinates, and the Lagrangian method
requires the use of independent coordinates. The variational proof back in Chapter 6 assumed this
independence.

406

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

Note that there are two conserved quantities, arising from the facts that ∂L/∂ψ
and ∂L/∂φ equal zero. The conserved quantities are the angular momenta in
the ˆx3 and ˆz directions, respectively. This is true because from Eq. (9.65), the
former is L3 = I3ω3 and the latter is Lz = L3 cos θ + L2 sin θ = (I3ω3) cos θ +
(I ˙φ sin θ) sin θ. These angular momenta are conserved because the torque points
in the ˆx1 direction, so there is no torque in the plane spanned by ˆx3 and ˆz.

9.7.5 Spinning top with ˙θ = 0
A special case of Eqs. (9.70) occurs when ˙θ = 0. In this case, the first of
Eqs. (9.70) says that ˙φ is constant. The CM of the top therefore undergoes uni-
form circular motion in a horizontal plane. Let (cid:18) ≡ ˙φ be the frequency of this
motion (this is the same notation as in Eq. (9.61)). Then the second of Eqs. (9.70)
becomes

I (cid:18)2 cos θ − I3ω3(cid:18) + Mg(cid:2) = 0.

(9.75)

This quadratic equation can be solved to yield two possible precessional frequen-
cies, (cid:18), for the top. And yes, there are indeed two of them, provided that ω3 is
greater than a certain minimum value.

The previous pages in this “Heavy symmetric top” section have been a bit
abstract, so let’s now take a breather and rederive Eq. (9.75) from scratch. That
is, we’ll assume ˙θ = 0 from the start of the solution, and then solve things by
finding L and using τ = dL/dt, in the spirit of Section 9.4.2. In practice, this
strategy of starting from scratch is invariably the best route to take, as you’ll see
in the problems and exercises for this chapter. The procedures in Sections 9.7.3
and 9.7.4 are good to know, but the technique in the following example provides
a much more intuitive way of looking at things. This example is the classic “top”
problem. We’ll warm up by solving it in an approximate way. Then we’ll do it
for real.

ω

CM

Example (The top): A symmetric top of mass M has its CM a distance (cid:2) from its
pivot. The moments of inertia relative to the pivot are I1 = I2 ≡ I , and I3. The top
spins around its symmetry axis with frequency ω3 (in the language of Section 9.7.2),
and initial conditions have been set up so that the CM precesses in a circle around
the vertical axis. The symmetry axis makes a constant angle θ with the vertical (see
Fig. 9.31).

Fig. 9.31

(a) Assuming that the angular momentum due to ω3 is much larger than any other
angular momentum in the problem, find an approximate expression for the
frequency, (cid:18), of precession.

(b) Now solve the problem exactly. That is, find (cid:18) by considering all of the angular

momentum.

9.7 Heavy symmetric top

407

Solution:

(a) The angular momentum (relative to the pivot) due to the spinning of the top
has magnitude L3 = I3ω3, and it is directed along ˆx3. Let’s label this angular
momentum vector as L3 ≡ L3 ˆx3. As the top precesses, L3 traces out a cone
around the vertical axis. So the tip of L3 moves in a circle of radius L3 sin θ.
The frequency of this circular motion is the frequency of precession, (cid:18). So
dL3/dt, which is the velocity of the tip, has magnitude

(cid:18)(L3 sin θ ) = (cid:18)I3ω3 sin θ,

(9.76)

and it is directed into the page.

The torque (relative to the pivot) is due to gravity acting on the CM, so it has
magnitude Mg(cid:2) sin θ , and it is directed into the page. Therefore, τ = dL/dt
gives

(cid:18) = Mg(cid:2)
I3ω3

.

(9.77)

This is independent of θ , and it is inversely proportional to ω3.

(b) The error in the above analysis is that we omitted the angular momentum aris-
ing from the ˆx2 (defined in Section 9.7.1) component of the angular velocity
due to the precession of the top around the ˆz axis. This component has magni-
tude (cid:18) sin θ .17 Therefore, the angular momentum due to the angular velocity
component in the ˆx2 direction has magnitude

L2 = I (cid:18) sin θ.

(9.78)

Let’s label this part of the angular momentum as L2 ≡ L2 ˆx2. The total L =
L2 + L3 is shown in Fig. 9.32. L precesses around in a cone, so only its
horizontal component (call it L⊥) changes. From the figure, the length L⊥ is
the difference in lengths of the horizontal components of L3 and L2. Therefore,

L⊥ = L3 sin θ − L2 cos θ = I3ω3 sin θ − I (cid:18) sin θ cos θ.

(9.79)

The magnitude of the rate of change of L is18

(9.80)

Both τ (which has magnitude Mg(cid:2) sin θ ) and dL/dt point into the page, so
equating their magnitudes gives

I (cid:18)2 cos θ − I3ω3(cid:18) + Mg(cid:2) = 0,

(9.81)

17 The angular velocity due to the precession is (cid:18)ˆz. We can break this up into components along
the orthogonal directions ˆx2 and ˆx3. The (cid:18) cos θ component along ˆx3 was already absorbed into
the definition of ω3 (see Fig. 9.30).

18 This result can also be obtained in a more formal way. Since L precesses with angular velocity
(cid:18)ˆz, the rate of change of L is dL/dt = (cid:18)ˆz × L. If you compute this cross product in the x1, x2, x3
basis, you will obtain the result in Eq. (9.80).

(9.82)

Note that if θ = π/2, then Eq. (9.81) is actually a linear equation, so there is
only one solution for (cid:18), which is the one in Eq. (9.77). The reason for this is
that L2 points vertically, so it doesn’t change. Only L3 contributes to dL/dt,
so the approximate solution in part (a) is in fact an exact solution. Because of
this simplification, a top is much easier to deal with when its symmetry axis is
horizontal.

The two solutions in Eq. (9.82) are known as the fast-precession and slow-
precession frequencies. For large ω3, you can show that the slow-precession
frequency is

(cid:18)− ≈ Mg(cid:2)
I3ω3

,

(9.83)

in agreement with the solution found in Eq. (9.77).19 This task, along with
many other interesting features of this problem (including the interpretation of
the fast-precession frequency, (cid:18)+), is the subject of Problem 9.17, which you
are encouraged to do.

9.7.6 An “explanation” of precession

The fact that a top can precess slowly around in a circle without simply falling
down (as a simple pendulum would do) is rather bizarre. We showed above that
this precession can be deduced perfectly well from τ = dL/dt, but it would be
nice if there was a more intuitive way to explain it, based at least somewhat on
F = ma. Although a completely satisfactory intuitive explanation eludes me, I
think the following discussion will clear some things up. This discussion will be
qualitative (so no equations or numbers), but it should still suffice in explaining
for the most part what’s going on with precession.

Impulse applied to a dumbbell
Let’s first look at a simple system consisting of a dumbbell with a massless stick
glued perpendicular to it at its center. The dumbbell rotates around the stick which
is held fixed; see Fig. 9.33. Let the y and z axes be defined as shown, with the x
axis pointing out of the page. The total angular momentum points to the right, in
the positive y direction. We’ll ignore gravity for now. Equivalently, we can have
the dumbbell pivoted at its center.

19 This is fairly clear. If ω3 is large enough compared with (cid:18), then we can ignore the first term in
Eq. (9.81). That is, we can ignore the effects of L2, which is exactly what we did in the approximate
solution in part (a).

At the instant the masses are in the plane of the paper, as shown (with the
top one coming out of the page and the bottom one going in), we’ll apply equal
and opposite small impulses to the stick, upward on the right end and downward
on the left; see Fig. 9.34.20 Assume that the forces are applied for infinitesimal
periods of time, but that the forces are large enough so that the impulse is nonzero.
What happens to the masses? In particular, what happens to the plane of their
rotation?

Because the structure is rigid, the impulsive forces on the stick cause the two
masses to pick up small velocity components in the ±y directions, as shown
in Fig. 9.34. If the forces are applied for an infinitesimal time t, then these
velocity components are of the form v = at (with t very small and a very large).
Additionally, the masses move a distance d = at2/2 to the side. But because
of the two powers of the infinitesimal time t here, this distance is negligible.
In other words, the masses pick up a nonzero v, but essentially no d. This is a
general result when an object is struck with a hammer: right after the blow, it has
a nonzero speed, but essentially zero displacement.

A top view (with the z axis pointing out of the page) of the velocities of the two
masses right after the blow is shown in Fig. 9.35. The dotted lines represent the
velocity of the bottom mass which is behind (that is, below) the top mass. Now,
if someone gives you these two velocities and doesn’t tell you what was going
on beforehand, then you will simply say that the dumbbell is rotating around in a
circle that lies in the vertical plane defined by the line of the new velocity vectors
in Fig 9.35. In other words, the plane of the circular motion has been rotated
around the vertical z axis. A top view of the situation is shown in Fig. 9.36. From
this time onward, the masses rotate around in the new vertical plane. This means
that the angular momentum of the dumbbell has picked up a component in the
positive x direction (out of the page in Fig. 9.34 and downward in Fig. 9.36),
consistent with the fact that the torque from the two applied forces points in the
positive x direction.

This example illustrates the bizarre fact that if you smack the rotation axis in

one direction (vertical here), it will head off in another direction (horizontal).

Impulse applied to a symmetric top
Let’s now consider the more complicated situation where instead of the above
dumbbell we have a symmetric top, for example, a flat disk with a stick pok-
ing through its center. (We’ll still ignore gravity for the moment.) Things are
more difficult now, because if we apply our impulsive forces to the stick, the
plane of the disk can’t instantaneously rotate as it did above, because this would
involve the “side” points on the disk moving a finite distance in zero time, as they

20 We’re applying equal and opposite forces just so that the CM doesn’t move. And we’re doing this
for no reason other than simplicity. The motion of the CM is irrelevant for the point we want to
make in this dumbbell setup.

410

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

move from the old plane of rotation to the new plane. So what does the motion
look like?

The rough answer is that our symmetric top is vaguely the same type of object
as the above dumbbell, so the motion should look roughly the same. In other
words, the axis of the top should end up pointing (in one way or another) a
little bit in the x direction, as it did with the dumbbell. But the precise answer
is that since we have a free top here, we know from the free-top discussion in
Section 9.6.2 exactly what happens: the symmetry axis of the disk precesses
(along with the angular velocity vector) in a thin cone around the new angular
momentum vector, which points slightly out of the page due to the torque in the x
direction. So although the symmetry axis of the disk doesn’t point in the definite
direction along L as it did with the dumbbell, it points on average along L, which
is slightly in the x direction.

Let’s now bring gravity into the setup. It turns out that we can consider a heavy
top’s precession to be the result of a succession of many little impulsive blows
to a free top that is otherwise in freefall (where gravity provides no torque). The
reasoning is as follows.

Imagine that we hold our spinning top (not pivoted anywhere) and move it
sideways (perpendicular to the stick) at a given constant speed; this speed will
have to be chosen to be a particular value (see Footnote 23 below). And then we
let go. Gravity provides a force on the CM, but zero torque around the CM, so
the top is simply in freefall with the constant horizontal speed that we gave it.
But let’s assume that immediately after we let go, we keep the top at a constant
height by applying a very quick and very small upward strike to the end of the
stick, and then waiting for a very short time while the CM rises and falls in its
freefall motion, and then repeating the process indefinitely (let’s say we make
100 tiny strikes each second). If we arrange for the time-averaged upward force
to equal mg, then the CM stays at (essentially) a constant height.

After each strike, the axis of the top undergoes its free-top precession in a very
thin cone, so if the CM of the top weren’t moving, the end of the stick would
end up pointing slightly to the side, along the direction of the new L. 21 But the
sideways motion of the top (due to the properly chosen original speed we gave it)
exactly brings the end of the stick back to its original location; see the top view in
Fig. 9.37. The dot in the figure represents a fixed point in space. We can imagine
this process taking place in two steps. In step 1, the axis changes its direction
due to the angular impulse relative to the CM. And in step 2, the top moves
sideways (due to the original horizontal speed we gave it) during its rising and
falling projectile motion. As the process repeats, the CM moves around in a circle,

21 Assume that the stick’s tiny precession cone around L somehow damps out, so that the stick
eventually points in the definite direction along L. Since we’re eventually going to consider the
end of the stick to be located at a pivot, this is a reasonable assumption.

with the end of the stick remaining (essentially) fixed.22 In other words, we have
recreated our precessing top.23 And since we can consider the continuous upward
force that a pivot applies to a heavy top to be a succession of quick infinitesimal
strikes, we see that a heavy top precessing around a pivot is essentially the same
as the above top precessing around the fixed dot in space in Fig. 9.37.

The above reasoning is only qualitative, but it should make the precession of
a heavy top a little more believable. Of course, since we’ve argued that a heavy
top pivoted at a point can be considered to be a free top undergoing a succession
of impulsive and free-top motions, we’ve just shifted the burden of proof to an
intuitive understanding of why a free top precesses the way it does. But that
makes my head hurt, so I’ll stop here. But at least we know that a free top should
behave more or less like the dumbbell setup above, for which we showed (by
actually looking at the forces) why the axis of rotation shifts to the side when
vertical forces are applied.

9.7.7 Nutation
We will now solve Eq. (9.70) in a somewhat more general case, where θ is
allowed to vary slightly. That is, we will consider a slight perturbation to the
circular motion associated with Eq. (9.75). We will assume that ω3 is large here,
and we will assume that the original circular motion corresponds to the slow
precession, so that ˙φ is small. Under these assumptions, we will find that the top
will bounce around slightly as it travels (roughly) in a circle. This bouncing is
known as nutation.

Since ˙φ is small compared with ω3, we can (to a good approximation) ignore

the middle terms on the left-hand sides of Eqs. (9.70) to obtain

I ¨φ sin θ − ˙θI3ω3 = 0,
˙φ) sin θ = I ¨θ.

(Mg(cid:2) − I3ω3

(9.84)

We must somehow solve these equations for θ(t) and φ(t). Taking the derivative
of the first equation and dropping the quadratic term (which is negligible for
sufficiently small perturbations) gives ¨θ = (I sin θ/I3ω3) d2 ˙φ/dt2. Substituting
this expression for ¨θ into the second equation gives

d2 ˙φ

+ ω2

( ˙φ − (cid:18)s) = 0,

(9.85)

22 We’ll need to apply a force directed along the axis, to provide the centripetal acceleration of the
precessing CM. But this force produces no torque around the CM, so it doesn’t affect any of the
other aspects of the problem.

23 If the initial conditions aren’t set up properly, then the top will bounce up and down as it precesses
around (this is known as nutation, described below in Section 9.7.7). In particular, if you hold
the axis at rest and then let go, the top will initially fall straight down. So your intuition works
perfectly fine here. But as time goes by, more complicated things start to happen, as explained in
Remark 6 in the nutation section below.

are, respectively, the frequency of nutation (as we shall soon see) and the slow-
precession frequency given in Eq. (9.77). Shifting variables to y ≡ ˙φ − (cid:18)s in
Eq. (9.85) gives us the nice harmonic-oscillator equation, ¨y + ω2
ny = 0. Solving
this and then shifting back to ˙φ yields

˙φ(t) = (cid:18)s + A cos(ωnt + γ ),
where A and γ are determined by the initial conditions. Integrating this gives

much, we can set sin θ ≈ sin θ0, where θ0 is, say, the initial value of θ(t). Any
errors here will be second-order effects in small quantities. Integration then gives

where B is a constant of integration. Equations (9.88) and (9.90) show that both
φ (neglecting the uniform (cid:18)st part) and θ oscillate with frequency ωn, and with
amplitudes inversely proportional to ωn. Note that Eq. (9.86) says that ωn grows
with ω3.

Example (Sideways kick): Assume that uniform circular precession is initially
taking place with θ = θ0 and ˙φ = (cid:18)s. You then give the top a quick kick along the
direction of motion, so that ˙φ suddenly becomes (cid:18)s + (cid:16)(cid:18) ((cid:16)(cid:18) may be positive or
negative). Find φ(t) and θ(t).

Solution: This is an exercise in initial conditions. We are given the initial values
of ˙φ, ˙θ , and θ (namely (cid:18)s + (cid:16)(cid:18), 0, and θ0, respectively), and our goal is to solve
for the unknowns A, B, and γ in Eqs. (9.87), (9.89), and (9.90). ˙θ is initially zero, so
Eq. (9.89) gives γ = 0 (or π, but this leads to the same answer). And ˙φ is initially
(cid:18)s + (cid:16)(cid:18), so Eq. (9.87) gives A = (cid:16)(cid:18). Finally, θ is initially θ0, so Eq. (9.90) gives
B = θ0 − ((cid:16)(cid:18)/ωn) sin θ0. Putting this all together, we have

φ(t) = (cid:18)st +

And for future reference (for the problems in this chapter), we’ll also list the
derivatives,

˙φ(t) = (cid:18)s + (cid:16)(cid:18) cos ωnt,
˙θ (t) = −(cid:16)(cid:18) sin θ0 sin ωnt.

(9.92)

Remarks:

1. Remember that all of this analysis holds only if ˙θ and ˙φ are small compared with ω3,

and if θ is always near θ0.

2. For the initial setup we have chosen (that is, for ˙θ = 0), Eq. (9.91) shows that θ
always stays on one side of θ0. If (cid:16)(cid:18) > 0, then θ (t) ≤ θ0 for all t (that is, the top is
always at a higher position, since θ is measured from the vertical). If (cid:16)(cid:18) < 0, then
θ(t) ≥ θ0 for all t (that is, the top is always at a lower position).

3. Consider the point that is a distance (cid:2) from the origin and that travels in a horizontal
(cid:6)
circle with angular coordinates given by (φ, θ)avg =
.
This is the “average” position of the CM, in the sense that Eq. (9.91) gives the angular
coordinates of the CM relative to this point as

(cid:18)st, θ0 − ((cid:16)(cid:18)/ωn) sin θ0

(cid:5)

(φ, θ)rel =

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(cid:16)(cid:18)
ωn

(sin ωnt, sin θ0 cos ωnt).

(9.93)

The sin θ0 in the second coordinate here implies that the amplitude of the θ oscillation
is sin θ0 times the amplitude of the φ oscillation. This is precisely the factor needed to
make the CM travel in a circle, as viewed by someone riding along with coordinates
(φ, θ)avg, because a change in θ causes a displacement of (cid:2) dθ , whereas a change in
φ causes a displacement of (cid:2) sin θ0 dφ.

4. Figure 9.38 shows plots of θ(t) vs. sin θ0φ(t) for various values of (cid:16)(cid:18). The
dots at the start of each of the nine plots all represent the same starting point at
θ = θ0. The plots are stacked on top of each other for comparison only; the ver-
tical spacing between them is meaningless. We have chosen the horizontal axis
to be sin θ0φ(t) instead of φ(t), and we have chosen the vertical axis to have θ
increasing downward, so that these plots are exactly the paths you would see the
CM trace out in space. We have picked arbitrary values of (cid:18)s and ωn to gener-
ate the plots (hence no numbers on the axes, since they wouldn’t mean much), but
no matter what values are picked, the shapes of the plots are still the same (for
example, the (cid:16)(cid:18) = ±(cid:18)s paths always have cusps). The oscillations have different
frequencies and amplitudes, but both axes get scaled by the same amount (as you can
check).

5. From the figure, we see that the motions associated with (cid:16)(cid:18) and −(cid:16)(cid:18) look the same
except for being shifted vertically (relative to the starting dots, which represent the
same point), and also horizontally by half a cycle. This can be seen from Eq. (9.91);
changing (cid:16)(cid:18) to −(cid:16)(cid:18) has the effect of shifting the constant term in θ (t), and also
shifting the time by half a cycle, because (cid:16)(cid:18) sin ωnt = (−(cid:16)(cid:18)) sin(ωnt + π), and
likewise for cosine.

6. In the (cid:16)(cid:18) = −(cid:18)s case, the CM starts at rest. This corresponds to holding the axis
of the top at rest and then dropping it. From Fig. 9.38 we see that initially the CM
simply falls straight down, as your intuition suggests. (It might not be clear from the
figure, but Problem 9.25 shows that the curve is indeed vertical at the high points in
the motion.) But then the strangeness of angular momentum takes over, and the top
ends up bouncing and precessing instead of continuing to fall as a point mass would.
Qualitatively, we can understand this bouncing and precessing as follows. Let the
axis and the angular momentum initially point to the right as you hold the axis, as

shown in Fig. 9.39. After you let go, a number of things happen: (1) Because of the
downward gravitational force, the top starts to fall. The axis therefore now points
slightly downward, which means that the angular momentum picks up a downward
component. Relative to the CM, the force from the pivot must therefore provide a
downward torque. By the right-hand rule, this force must point into the page. (2)
From F = ma, this inward force causes the top to accelerate into the page. This
makes the axis point slightly into the page, so the angular momentum picks up a
component in that direction. By the right-hand rule, there must then be an upward
force from the pivot to provide the necessary torque for this. (3) This upward force
slows down the downward motion and in fact eventually becomes greater than mg
and causes the CM to rise back up. This means that the angular momentum increases
its vertical component, so by the right-hand rule there must be a force from the pivot
that points out of the page to provide the necessary torque for this. (4) This outward
force then slows down the motion into the page and eventually stops it, right when
the top returns to its original height. The top is momentarily at rest, and then the
process repeats itself. Of course, this qualitative reasoning doesn’t show that all the
details work out correctly, but at least it makes the motion a little more believable.
7. If you start by holding the axis of the top at rest, as in the previous remark, the (cid:16)(cid:18) = 0
case corresponds to giving the axis the proper initial push into the page (instead of
just dropping it, as above) so that the resulting change in angular momentum into the
page requires an upward force of mg from the pivot. The CM then stays at the same
height and simply moves in a horizontal circle without bouncing. ♣

9.1. Many different ω’s *

Consider a particle at the point (a, 0, 0), with velocity (0, v, 0). At this

ent ω vectors passing through the origin. There isn’t just one “correct” ω.
Find all the possible ω’s (give their directions and magnitudes).

9.3. Rolling cone **

A cone rolls without slipping on a table. The half-angle at the vertex is α,

the base, point P in the figure, be v. What is the angular velocity of the
cone with respect to the lab frame at the instant shown? There are many
ways to do this problem, so you are encouraged to take a look at the three
given solutions, even after solving it.

9.6. Rotating square *

ω

Here’s an exercise in geometry. Theorem 9.5 says that if the moments of
inertia around two principal axes are equal, then any axis in the plane of
these axes is a principal axis. This means that the object will happily rotate
around any axis in this plane, that is, no torque is needed. Demonstrate this
explicitly for four equal masses in the shape of a square, with the center
as the origin, which obviously has two moments equal. Assume that the
masses are connected by strings to the axis, as shown in Fig. 9.41, and
that they all rotate with the same ω around the axis, so that they remain in
the shape of a square. Your task is to show that the tensions in the strings

Fig. 9.41

416

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

are such that there is no net torque acting on the axis, relative to the center
of the square.

9.7. Existence of principal axes for a pancake *

Given a pancake object in the x-y plane, show that there exist principal
axes by considering what happens to the integral
xy when the coordinate
axes are rotated about the origin by an angle of π/2.

A flat uniform rectangle with sides of length a and b sits in space, not
rotating. You strike the corners at the ends of one diagonal, with equal

points along the other diagonal.

9.10. Rotating stick **

A stick of mass m and length (cid:2) spins with frequency ω around an axis,
as shown in Fig. 9.43. The stick makes an angle θ with the axis and is
kept in its motion by two strings that are perpendicular to the axis. What
is the tension in the strings? (Ignore gravity.)

9.11. Stick under a ring **

A stick of mass m and length (cid:2) is arranged to have its CM motionless

different ways.

(a) Use F = ma. This method works only if you have a point mass.
With an extended object, you have to use one of the following
methods involving torque.

(b) Use τ = dL/dt with the pendulum pivot as the origin.
(c) Use τ = dL/dt with the mass as the origin.

9.13. Rolling in a cone **

A fixed cone stands on its tip, with its axis in the vertical direction.
The half-angle at the vertex is θ. A small ring of radius r rolls without
slipping on the inside surface. Assume that conditions have been set up
so that (1) the point of contact between the ring and the cone moves in
a circle at height h above the tip, and (2) the plane of the ring is at all
times perpendicular to the line joining the point of contact and the tip
of the cone (see Fig. 9.45). What is the frequency, (cid:18), of this circular
motion? Work in the approximation where r is much smaller than the
radius of the circular motion, h tan θ.

Section 9.5: Euler’s equations

9.14. Tennis racket theorem ***

If you try to spin a tennis racket (or a book, etc.) around any of its
three principal axes, you will find that different things happen with the
different axes. Assuming that the principal moments (relative to the
CM) are labeled according to I1 > I2 > I3 (see Fig. 9.46), you will
find that the racket will spin nicely around the ˆx1 and ˆx3 axes, but it
will wobble in a rather messy manner around the ˆx2 axis. Verify this
claim experimentally with a book (preferably lightweight, and wrapped
with a rubber band), or a tennis racket, if you happen to study with one
on hand.

Now verify this claim mathematically. The main point here is that
you can’t start the motion off with ω pointing exactly along a principal
axis. Therefore, what you want to show is that the motion around the
ˆx1 and ˆx3 axes is stable (that is, small errors in the initial conditions
remain small), whereas the motion around the ˆx2 axis is unstable (that
is, small errors in the initial conditions get larger and larger, until the
motion eventually doesn’t resemble a rotation around the ˆx2 axis).24
Your task is to use Euler’s equations to prove these statements about
stability. (Exercise 9.33 gives another derivation of this result.)

24 If you try for a long enough time, you’ll probably be able to get the initial ω pointing close enough
to ˆx2 so that the book will remain rotating (almost) around ˆx2 for the entire time of its flight. There
is, however, undoubtedly a better use for your time, as well as for the book…

9.15. Free-top angles *

In Section 9.6.2, we showed that for a free symmetric top, the angular
momentum L, the angular velocity ω, and the symmetry axis ˆx3 all lie
in a plane. Let α be the angle between ˆx3 and L, and let β be the angle
between ˆx3 and ω (see Fig. 9.47). Find the relationship between α and
β in terms of the principal moments, I and I3.

A top with I = nI3, where n is a numerical factor, is initially spin-
ning around its x3 axis with angular speed ω3. You apply a strike at
the bottom point, directed into the page as shown in Fig. 9.48 (imag-

largest value of n for which the total ω vector never dips below the
horizontal axis in the subsequent motion, no matter how hard your
strike is?

is possible?

(b) Find approximate expressions for (cid:18)± when ω3 is very large.
The phrase “very large,” however, is rather meaningless. What
mathematical statement should replace it?

9.18. Many tops **

N identical disks and massless sticks are arranged as shown in Fig. 9.49.
Each disk is glued to the stick on its left and attached by a pivot to the
stick on its right. The leftmost stick is attached by a pivot to a pole.
You wish to set up circular precession with the sticks always forming a
straight horizontal line. What should the relative angular speeds of the
disks be so that this is possible?

Solve the problem of a heavy symmetric top spinning on a fric-

what modifications are needed in the derivation in Section 9.7.3 (or
Section 9.7.4).

9.20. Fixed highest point **

Consider a top made of a uniform disk of radius R, connected to the
origin by a massless stick (which is glued perpendicular to the disk) of
length (cid:2). Paint a dot on the top at its highest point, and label this as
point P (see Fig. 9.51). You wish to set up uniform circular precession,
with the stick making a constant angle θ with the vertical (θ can be
chosen to be any angle between zero and π), and with P always being
the highest point on the top. What is the frequency of precession, (cid:18)?
What relation between R and (cid:2) must be satisfied for this motion to be
possible?

9.21. Basketball on a rim ***

A basketball rolls without slipping around a basketball rim in such a way
that the contact points trace out a great circle on the ball, and the CM
moves around in a horizontal circle with frequency (cid:18). The radii of the
ball and rim are r and R, respectively, and the ball’s radius to the contact
point makes an angle θ with the horizontal (see Fig. 9.52). Assume that
the ball’s moment of inertia around its center is I = (2/3)mr2. Find (cid:18).

9.22. Rolling lollipop ***

Consider a lollipop made of a solid sphere of mass m and radius r that is
radially pierced by a massless stick. The free end of the stick is pivoted
on the ground (see Fig. 9.53). The sphere rolls on the ground without
slipping, with its center moving in a circle of radius R with frequency (cid:18).
What is the normal force between the ground and the sphere?

9.23. Rolling coin ***

Initial conditions have been set up so that a coin of radius r rolls around
in a circle, as shown in Fig. 9.54. The contact point on the ground traces
out a circle of radius R, and the coin makes a constant angle θ with
the horizontal. The coin rolls without slipping (assume that the friction
with the ground is as large as needed). What is the frequency, (cid:18), of
the circular motion of the contact point on the ground? Show that such
motion exists only if R > (5/6)r cos θ.

9.24. Wobbling coin ***

If you spin a coin around a vertical diameter on a table, it will slowly
lose energy and begin a wobbling motion. The angle between the coin
and the table will gradually decrease, and eventually it will come to rest.
Assume that this process is slow, and consider the motion when the coin
makes an angle θ with the table (see Fig. 9.55). You may assume that
the CM is essentially motionless. Let R be the radius of the coin, and let
(cid:18) be the frequency at which the contact point on the table traces out its
circle. Assume that the coin rolls without slipping.

(a) Using the notation and initial conditions in the example in
Section 9.7.7, prove that kinks occur in nutation if and only if
(cid:16)(cid:18) = ±(cid:18)s. A kink is where the plot of θ(t) vs. φ(t) has a
discontinuity in its slope.

(b) Prove that these kinks are in fact cusps. A cusp is a kink where

the plot reverses direction in the φ-θ plane.

9.26. Nutation circles **

(a) Using the notation and initial conditions in the example in
Section 9.7.7, and assuming that ω3 (cid:6) (cid:16)(cid:18) (cid:6) (cid:18)s, find (approx-
imately) the direction of the angular momentum right after the
sideways kick takes place.

(b) Use Eq. (9.91) to show that the CM then travels (approximately) in
a circle around L. And show that this “circular” motion is just what
you would expect from the free-top reasoning in Section 9.6.2, in
particular, Eq. (9.55).

Additional problems

9.27. Rolling without slipping *

The standard way that a ball rolls without slipping on a flat surface is
for the contact points on the ball to trace out a vertical great circle on
the ball. Are there any other ways that a ball can roll without slipping?

9.28. Rolling straight? **

In some situations, such as the rolling-coin setup in Problem 9.23, the
velocity of the CM of a rolling object changes direction as time goes by.
Consider a uniform sphere that rolls on the ground without slipping (pos-
sibly in the nonstandard way described in the solution to Problem 9.27).

9.29. Ball on paper ***

A uniform ball rolls without slipping on a table (possibly in the non-
standard way described in the solution to Problem 9.27). It rolls onto a
piece of paper, which you then slide around in an arbitrary (horizontal)
manner. You may even give the paper abrupt, jerky motions, so that the
ball slips with respect to it. After you allow the ball to come off the
paper, it will eventually resume rolling without slipping on the table.
Show that the final velocity equals the initial velocity.

9.30. Ball on a turntable ****

A uniform ball rolls without slipping on a turntable (possibly in the
nonstandard way described in the solution to Problem 9.27). As viewed
from the inertial lab frame, show that the ball moves in a circle (not
necessarily centered at the center of the turntable) with a frequency
equal to 2/7 times the frequency of the turntable.

A wheel with spokes rolls without slipping on the ground. A stationary
camera takes a picture of it as it rolls by, from the side. Due to the nonzero

what locations in the picture do the spokes not appear blurred? Hint: A
common incorrect answer is that there is only one point.

9.33. Tennis racket theorem **

Problem 9.14 gives the statement of the “tennis racket theorem,” and the
solution there involves Euler’s equations. Demonstrate the theorem here
by writing down the conservation of L2 and conservation of E statements
and then using them in the following way. Produce an equation that says

422

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

that if ω2 and ω3 (or ω1 and ω2) start small, then they must remain
small. And produce the analogous equation that says that if ω1 and ω3
start small, then they need not remain small. (It’s another matter to show
that they actually won’t remain small. But let’s not worry about that here.
Anything that can happen generally does happen in physics.)

9.34. Moments for a cube **

In the spirit of Appendix E, calculate the principal moments for a solid
cube of mass m and side length (cid:2), with the coordinate axes parallel to
the edges of the cube, and the origin at a corner.

9.35. Tilted moments **

(a) Consider a planar object in the x-y plane. If the x and y axes are
principal axes, use the rotation matrix in Eq. (9.94) to show that
the moment of inertia around the x(cid:16) axis, which makes an angle
θ with the x axis, is Ix(cid:16) = Ix cos2θ + Iy sin2θ.

(b) Consider a general three-dimensional object whose principal axes
are the x, y, and z axes. Consider another axis that points along
the unit vector (α, β, γ ). Show that the moment of inertia around
this axis is α2Ix + β2Iy + γ 2Iz. Hint: The cross product, discussed
in Appendix B, provides a nice method of calculating the distance
from a point to a line.

9.36. Quadrupole **

origin. Using the law of cosines, the gravitational potential of a mass M
at position R is

(b) Consider now a planet with rotational symmetry around ˆx3, such
as the earth which bulges at the equator due to the spinning. Using

Remark: The second term here is known as the quadrupole term. In elec-
trostatics, a dipole consists of equal and opposite charges separated by some
distance d. At a given point far away, the forces from these two charges par-
tially cancel. But they don’t exactly cancel, because the electrostatic force
(which behaves like the gravitational force, with a 1/r2 law) depends on
the distance and direction to the charges, and the two charges are located at
different points. If two dipoles are oriented in opposite directions and then
placed side by side, a distance d apart (so that there are charges of q and −q
alternating around the corners of a square) then the forces from the dipoles
nearly cancel. But again, the cancellation isn’t exact, because the dipoles are
located in different places. This distribution of charge is called a quadrupole,
and it is similar to the situation with a spinning (and bulging) planet, because
such a planet consists of a spherical ball (which gives rise to the first term in
Eq. (9.101)), plus a region of “negative” mass superimposed on the ball at
the poles and a region of positive mass superimposed on the ball at the equa-
tor. Looking at the above square of charges from far out along the diagonal
containing the two negative charges is similar to looking at the earth from
far out along its rotation axis. ♣

Section 9.4: Two basic types of problems

9.37. Sphere and points *

A uniform sphere of mass m and radius R rotates around the vertical axis
with angular speed ω. Two particles of mass m/2 are brought close to the
sphere at diametrically opposite points, at an angle θ from the vertical,
as shown in Fig. 9.56. The masses, which are initially essentially at rest,
abruptly stick to the sphere. What angle does the resulting ω make with
the vertical? (If you want, you can check your answer by showing that
the θ that makes this angle maximum is sin−1

raised until its top end collides with the center of the top stick. The sticks
stick together to form a rigid “T.” Assume that the collision takes place
when the top stick lies in the plane of the paper. Immediately after the
collision, one point (in addition to the CM) on the T will instantaneously
be at rest. Where is this point?

9.42. Pivot and string **

A stick of mass m and length (cid:2) spins with frequency ω around an axis,
as shown in Fig. 9.60. The stick makes an angle θ with the axis. One
end is pivoted on the axis, and the other end is connected to the axis
by a string that is perpendicular to the axis. What is the tension in the
string, and what is the force that the pivot applies to the stick? (Ignore
gravity.)

rim, as shown in Fig. 9.63, giving the coin an angular velocity com-
ponent ω⊥ in the plane of the coin. Consider the nth time the plane of
the coin returns to its original plane. What is the minimum value of n
for which it is possible for the coin to have exactly the same orienta-
tion as when it started? What should ω⊥ be in terms of ω3 to achieve
this?

9.48. Seeing tails **

A coin (floating in outer space) of mass m and radius R is initially spin-
ning around the axis perpendicular to its plane, with angular speed ω3.
You view the coin directly from above, and you apply a downward
strike at a point on the rim, as shown in Fig. 9.63. What is the minimum
impulse,
F dt, you must apply in order to be able to barely see the
underside of the coin at some later time in its wobbling motion? Assum-
ing that you apply this minimum impulse, how far will the center of the
coin have moved by the time you are able to see the underside?

Imagine flipping an initially horizontal heads-up coin. If the initial angu-

diameter the entire time in the air. The fraction of the flight time that
the coin spends heads-up is therefore 1/2. In practice, however, it is
impossible to make the initial ω be exactly horizontal, so assume that
the initial components are ω⊥ and ω3, with ω3 (cid:4) ω⊥. Show that in

Consider a lollipop made of a solid sphere of mass m and radius r that
is radially pierced by a massless horizontal stick. The free end of the
stick is pivoted on a pole (see Fig. 9.65), and the sphere rolls on the
ground without slipping, with its center moving in a circle of radius R
with frequency (cid:18). What is the normal force between the ground and the
sphere?
9.52. Horizontal ω **

A top (with mass m, moments I and I3, and distance (cid:2) from the pivot
to CM) undergoes uniform precession, with its axis making a constant
angle θ with the negative z axis, as shown in Fig. 9.66. If conditions are
set up so that the top’s ω is always horizontal, what is the frequency of
precession? Can such motion exist if the top is up above the horizontal,
making an angle θ with the positive z axis?

26 If the coin starts truly horizontal (or is at least not biased to tilt in any particular direction on
average, which is still a condition that seems difficult to guarantee), and if you catch the coin in
your hand to reduce random table-bouncing effects, then the result of this exercise implies that
the coin is biased to come up heads. This effect is analyzed in detail in a paper by Persi Diaconis,
Susan Holmes, and Richard Montgomery (to be published), who estimate that the probability of
obtaining heads for a normally flipped coin is about 0.51.

Consider a lollipop made of a solid sphere of mass m and radius r that is
radially pierced by a massless stick. The free end of the stick is pivoted
on the ground, which is frictionless (see Fig. 9.67). The sphere slides
along the ground, with the same point on the sphere always touching
the ground. The center moves in a circle of radius R with frequency
(cid:18). Show that the normal force between the ground and the sphere is

The angle at the vertex of the cone is 60◦. Initial conditions have been
set up so that the contact point on the cone traces out a horizontal circle
of radius (cid:2) at frequency (cid:18), while the contact point on the ball traces out
a circle of radius R/2. Assume that the coefficient of friction between
the ball and the cone is sufficiently large to prevent slipping. What is the
frequency of precession, (cid:18)? What does it reduce to in the limits (cid:2) (cid:6) R

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

of the cone is θ. Initial conditions have been set up so that the contact
point on the cone traces out a horizontal circle of radius (cid:2) (cid:6) R, at
frequency (cid:18), while the contact point on the ball traces out a circle of
radius r (not necessarily equal to R, as would be the case for a great
circle). Assume that the coefficient of friction between the ball and the
cone is sufficiently large to prevent slipping. What is the frequency of
precession, (cid:18)? It turns out that (cid:18) can be made infinite if r/R takes

case, but they very much do in the (cid:16)(cid:18) = 10(cid:18)s case (a given loop there
actually intersects the two on either side). Show that the value of k for
which adjacent loops in the (cid:16)(cid:18) = k(cid:18)s case barely touch each other (as
shown in Fig. 9.70) is k ≈ 4.6033. You will have to solve something
numerically. Hint: The curve is vertical at the relevant points.

9.10 Solutions

9.1. Many different ω’s

We want to find all the vectors ω with the property that ω × aˆx = v ˆy. Since ω is
orthogonal to this cross product, ω must lie in the x-z plane. We claim that if ω makes
an angle θ with the x axis and has magnitude v/(a sin θ ), then it satisfies ω × aˆx = v ˆy.
Indeed,

ω × aˆx = |ω||aˆx| sin θ ˆy = v ˆy.

Alternatively, note that such an ω can be written as
(cid:7)

ω =

v

(cos θ , 0, sin θ ) =

(cid:8)

.

(9.103)

(9.104)

Only the z component here is relevant in the cross product with aˆx, so we have ω×aˆx =
(v/a)ˆz × aˆx = v ˆy. The answer to the problem is therefore that ω must take the form
given in Eq. (9.104).

It makes sense that the magnitude of ω is v/(a sin θ ), because if we drop a perpen-
dicular from the particle to the line of ω, we see that the particle may be considered
to be instantaneously traveling in a circle of radius r = a sin θ around ω, at speed
v. And so we have v = ωr, as we should. Whether the particle actually does travel
in this circle is irrelevant. The past and future motion doesn’t matter in finding the
instantaneous ω. All we need to know is the velocity at the given instant.

A few possible ω’s are drawn in Fig. 9.71. Technically, it is possible to have π <
θ < 2π, but then the v/(a sin θ ) coefficient in Eq. (9.104) is negative, which means
that ω really points upward in the x-z plane (physically, ω must point upward if the
particle’s velocity is to be in the positive y direction). So we’ll assume 0 < θ < π.
And since the v/a value of ωz in Eq. (9.104) is independent of θ , all of the possible
ω’s look like those in Fig. 9.72.

For θ = π/2, we have ω = v/a, which makes sense. If θ is very small, then ω
is very large, because ω ∝ 1/ sin θ . This also makes sense, because the particle is
(instantaneously) traveling around in a very small circle at the given speed v.

Remark: The point of this problem is that the particle may be in the process of having
its position vector trace out a cone around one of many possible axes, or perhaps it may
be undergoing a more complicated motion. If we are handed only the given information
on position and velocity, then it is impossible to determine which of these motions is
happening. And it is likewise impossible to uniquely determine ω. This is true for a
collection of points that lie on at most one line through the origin. If the points, along
with the origin, span more than a 1-D line, then ω is in fact uniquely determined (see
Footnote 9). ♣

9.2. Fixed points on a sphere

First solution: For the purposes of Theorem 9.1, we need only show that two points
end up where they started for an infinitesimal transformation. But since it’s possible
to prove this for a general transformation, we’ll consider the general case here.

Consider the point A that ends up farthest away from where it started.28 Label the
ending point B. Draw the great circle, CAB, through A and B. Draw the great circle, CA,
that is perpendicular to CAB at A; and draw the great circle, CB, that is perpendicular
to CAB at B. We claim that the transformation must take CA to CB. This is true for the
following reason. The image of CA is certainly a great circle through B. And this great
circle must be perpendicular to CAB, because otherwise there would exist another point
that ended up farther away from its starting point than A did (see Fig. 9.73). Since there
is only one great circle through B that is perpendicular to CAB, the image of CA must
in fact be CB.

Now consider the two points, P1 and P2, where CA and CB intersect (any two great
circles intersect in two points). Look at P1. The distances P1A and P1B are equal,
because CAB makes equal angles (namely 90◦) with CA and CB. Therefore, the point
P1 is not moved by the transformation. This is true because P1 ends up on CB (because
CB is the image of CA, on which P1 started), and if it ended up at a point other than P1,
then its final distance from B would be different from its initial distance from A. This
would contradict the fact that distances are preserved on the rigid sphere. Likewise for
P2. We have therefore found our two desired points.

Note that for a noninfinitesimal transformation, every point on the sphere may move
at some time during the transformation. But what we’ve just shown is that two points
end up back where they started, even if they’ve moved in the interim.

Second solution:
but one that is valid only in the case of infinitesimal transformations.

In the spirit of the above solution, we can give a simpler solution,

Pick any point A that moves during the transformation. Draw the great circle that
passes through A and is perpendicular to the direction of A’s motion. (This direction is
well defined, because we are considering an infinitesimal transformation, so A doesn’t
have time to change direction.) All points on this great circle must move (if they move
at all) perpendicular to the great circle, because otherwise their distances from A would
change. But they cannot all move in the same direction, because then the center of
the great circle, and hence the sphere, would move (but it is assumed to be fixed).
Therefore, at least one point on the great circle moves in the direction opposite to the
direction in which A moves. Therefore, by continuity, some point (and hence also its
diametrically opposite point) on the great circle must remain fixed.

9.3. Rolling cone

At the risk of overdoing it, we’ll present three solutions. The second and third solutions
are the type that might make your head hurt, so you may want to reread them after
looking at the discussion of the angular velocity vector in Section 9.7.2.

28 If there is more than one such point, pick any one of them. Considering that the result of this
problem is that the net motion of the sphere is a rotation around an axis, there will in fact be a
whole great circle of points that move farthest.

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

First solution: Without doing any calculations, we know that ω points along the
line of contact of the cone with the table, because these are the points on the cone that
are instantaneously at rest. And we know that as time goes by, ω rotates around in the
horizontal plane with angular speed v/(h cos α), because point P travels at speed v in
a circle of radius h cos α around the z axis.

The magnitude of ω can be found as follows. At a given instant, P may be considered
to be rotating in a circle of radius d = h sin α around ω (see Fig. 9.74). Since P moves
with speed v, the angular speed of this rotation is ω = v/d. Therefore,

ω =

v
h sin α .

(9.105)

Second solution: We can use Theorem 9.3 with the following frames. S1 is fixed in
the cone; S3 is the lab frame; and S2 is the frame that (instantaneously) rotates around
the tilted ω2,3 axis shown in Fig. 9.75, at the speed such that the axis of the cone
remains fixed in S2. The tip of ω2,3 traces out a circle as it precesses around the z axis,
so after the cone moves a little, we will need to use a new S2 frame. But at any moment,
S2 instantaneously rotates around the axis perpendicular to the axis of the cone.

In the language of Theorem 9.3, ω1,2 and ω2,3 point in the directions shown. We
must find their magnitudes and then add the vectors to determine the angular velocity
of S1 with respect to S3. First, we have

|ω2,3| =

v

h

,

(9.106)

because point P moves (instantaneously) with speed v in a circle of radius h around
ω2,3. We now claim that

|ω1,2| =

v

r

=

v
h tan α ,

(9.107)

where r is the radius of the base of the cone. This is true because someone fixed in
S2 sees the endpoint of the radius (the one drawn in Fig. 9.75) move “backward” at
speed v, because it is stationary with respect to the table. Hence, the cone must be
spinning with frequency v/r in S2.

The addition of ω1,2 and ω2,3 is shown in Fig. 9.76. The result has magnitude

v/(h sin α), and it points horizontally because |ω2,3|/|ω1,2| = tan α.

Third solution: We can use Theorem 9.3 with the following frames. S1 is fixed in
the cone; and S3 is the lab frame (as in the second solution). But now let S2 be the
frame that rotates around the (negative) z axis, at the speed such that the axis of the
cone remains fixed in it. Note that we can keep using this same S2 frame as time goes
by, unlike the S2 frame in the second solution.

ω1,2 and ω2,3 point in the directions shown in Fig. 9.77. As above, we must find
their magnitudes and then add the vectors to determine the angular velocity of S1 with
respect to S3. First, we have

|ω2,3| =

v
h cos α ,

(9.108)

because point P moves with speed v in a circle of radius h cos α around ω2,3.

It’s a little tricker to find |ω1,2|. From the point of view of someone spinning
around with S2, the table rotates backward with frequency |ω2,3| = v/(h cos α), from
Eq. (9.108). Consider the circle of contact points on the table where the base of the
cone touches it. This circle has a radius h/ cos α, so someone spinning around with
S2 sees the circle move backward with speed |ω2,3|(h/ cos α) = v/ cos2α around the
vertical. Since there is no slipping, the contact point on the cone must also move with
this speed in S2 around the axis of the cone (which is fixed in S2). And since the radius
of the base is r, this means that the cone rotates with angular speed v/(r cos2α) with

9.10 Solutions

431

respect to S2. Therefore, using r = h tan α, we have

|ω1,2| =

v
r cos2α

=

v
h sin α cos α .

(9.109)

The addition of ω1,2 and ω2,3 is shown in Fig. 9.78. The result has magnitude
v/(h sin α), and it points horizontally because |ω2,3|/|ω1,2| = sin α.

ω 1 , 2

Remark: The difference between the ω1,2 vectors in the second and third solutions
comes down to the following fact. Let Q be the contact point on the base of the cone.
Consider the ratio of the distance from Q to ω2,3 to the distance from P to ω2,3. This
ratio is 1 in the second solution, but 1/ cos2α in the third solution. This implies that
the “backward” speed of Q relative to P, as measured in frame S2, is a factor 1/ cos2α
larger in the third solution. And since Q is the same distance r away from ω1,2 in both
cases, we see that ω1,2 is a factor 1/ cos2α larger in the third solution. ♣

9.5. A nice cylinder

By symmetry, the principal axes are the symmetry axis of the cylinder, along with any
diameters in the cross-section circle through the CM. Let the equal moments around
the diameters be I . Then by Theorem 9.5, if the moment around the symmetry axis
also equals I , then every axis is a principal axis.

Let the mass of the cylinder be M . Let its radius be R and its height be h. Then the
moment around the symmetry axis is MR2/2. Let D be a diameter through the CM.
The moment around D can be calculated as follows. Slice the cylinder into horizontal
disks of thickness dy. Let ρ be the mass per unit height (so ρ = M /h). The mass of
each disk is then ρ dy, so the moment around a diameter through the disk is (ρ dy)R2/4
(the usual result for a disk). Therefore, by the parallel-axis theorem, the moment of a
disk at height y (where −h/2 ≤ y ≤ h/2) around D is (ρ dy)R2/4 + (ρ dy)y2. Hence,
the moment of the entire cylinder around D is

Eq. (9.112) looks just like the moment of a disk around a diameter plus the moment of
a stick around its center. This is no coincidence. The integral that yielded the Mh2/12
term here is the same integral that we would perform for a stick.

9.6. Rotating square

Label two of the masses A and B, as shown in Fig. 9.79. Let (cid:2)A be the distance along
the axis from the CM to A’s string, and let rA be the length of A’s string. Likewise
for B. The force, FA, in A’s string must account for the centripetal acceleration of A.
Hence, FA = mrAω2. The torque around the CM due to FA is therefore

τA = mrA(cid:2)Aω2.

(9.113)

Likewise, the torque around the CM due to B’s string is τB = mrB(cid:2)Bω2, in the opposite
direction. But the two shaded triangles in Fig. 9.79 are congruent, because they have
the same hypotenuse and the same angle θ . Therefore, (cid:2)A = rB and (cid:2)B = rA. Hence,
τA = τB, and the torques cancel. The torques from the other two masses likewise
cancel. Note that a uniform square is made up of many sets of these squares of point
masses, so we’ve also shown that no torque is needed for a uniform square.

Remark: For a general N -gon of point masses, Problem 9.8 below shows that any
axis in the plane is a principal axis. Let’s prove this here by using the above torque
argument. We’ll use a math trick here that involves writing a trig function (a sine) as
the imaginary part of a complex exponential. Using Eq. (9.113), we see that the torque
from mass A in Fig. 9.80 is τA = mω2R2 sin φ cos φ. Likewise, the torque from mass
B is τB = mω2R2 sin(φ + 2π/N ) cos(φ + 2π/N ), and so on. The total torque around
the CM is therefore

To obtain the fifth line, we summed the geometric series. And to obtain the last line,
we used the fact that e4πi = 1. The one exception to this result is when N = 2, because
the denominator in the fifth line is zero (but it’s hard to have a 2-gon, anyway); this
corresponds to the θ (cid:13)= 180◦ restriction in Theorem 9.6.

Note that what we’ve done here is show that

ri(cid:2)i = 0, which implies that the
total torque is zero (which is one of the definitions of a principal axis). In terms of
xy = 0, that is, showing that the
the chosen axis, this is equivalent to showing that
off-diagonal terms in the inertia tensor vanish (which is simply another definition of
the principal axes). ♣

9.7. Existence of principal axes for a pancake

xy = 0, then I will be diagonal,
Therefore, if we can find a set of axes for which
and we will have found our principal axes. We can prove, using a continuity argument,

If I0 (cid:13)= 0, then rotate these axes by an angle of π/2, so that the new ˆx is the old ˆy,

and the new ˆy is the old −ˆx (see Fig. 9.81). Write down the new integral

(cid:17)
have Iπ/2 = − I0. Therefore, since
xy switches sign during the (continuous) rotation
of the axes, there must exist some intermediate angle for which the integral

9.8. Symmetries and principal axes for a pancake

In view of the form of the inertia tensor in Eq. (9.8), we want to show that if a pancake
object has a symmetry under a rotation through θ (cid:13)= π, then
xy = 0 for any set of
axes (through the origin). Take an arbitrary set of axes and rotate them through an angle
θ (cid:13)= π. The new coordinates are x(cid:16) = (x cos θ + y sin θ ) and y(cid:16) = (−x sin θ + y cos θ ),
so the new matrix entries, in terms of the old ones, are

0 = −Ixx sin2θ + 2Ixy sin θ cos θ + Iyy sin2θ ,

Multiplying the first of these by cos θ and the second by sin θ , and subtracting,
gives

(9.116)

2Ixy sin θ = 0.
Under the assumption θ (cid:13)= π (and θ (cid:13)= 0, of course), we must therefore have Ixy = 0.
Our initial axes were arbitrary; hence, any set of axes (through the origin) in the plane
is a set of principal axes.

(9.117)

If an object is invariant under a rotation through an angle θ , then θ must be
Remark:
of the form θ = 2π/N , for some integer N (convince yourself of this). So consider a
regular N -gon with “radius” R and with point masses m located at the vertices. Any
object that is invariant under a rotation through θ = 2π/N may be considered to be
built out of regular point-mass N -gons of various sizes. Theorem 9.5 implies that all
axes in the plane of a regular N -gon have the same moment (the two axes in this theorem
aren’t required to be orthogonal). Let’s demonstrate this explicitly for a regular N -gon.
This method we’ll use here is similar to the one in the remark in Problem 9.6, except
that now we’ll write a trig function (a cosine) as the real part of a complex exponential.
In Fig. 9.82 the distance from mass A to the axis is rA = R sin φ. And the distance from
B to the axis is RB = R sin(φ + 2π/N ), and so on for the other masses. The moment
of inertia around the axis is therefore

NmR2. ♣

9.9. Striking a rectangle

τ 

If the force is out of the page at the upper left corner and into the page at the lower
right corner, then the torque τ = r × F points upward to the right, as shown in
Fig. 9.83, with τ ∝ (b, a). The angular momentum equals
τ dt, so immediately after
the strike, L is proportional to (b, a). But the angular momentum may also be written
as L = (Ixωx, Iyωy), where Ix = mb2/12 and Iy = ma2/12 are the principal moments.
Therefore, we have

which is the direction of the other diagonal. This result checks in the special case a = b,
and also in the limit where one of a and b is much larger than the other. Basically, if b
is much larger than a, then this largeness matters more in the moment of inertia around
the x axis (which is quadratic in length) than it does in the torque in the x direction
(which is linear in length), so there is very little rotation around the x axis.

9.10. Rotating stick

The angular momentum around the CM can be found as follows. Break ω up into its
components along the principal axes of the stick (which are parallel and perpendicu-
lar to the stick). The moment of inertia around the stick is zero. Therefore, only the
component of ω perpendicular to the stick is relevant in calculating L. This compo-
nent is ω sin θ, and the associated moment of inertia is m(cid:2)2/12. Hence, the angular
momentum at any time has magnitude

L = 1
12

m(cid:2)2ω sin θ ,

(9.121)

and it points as shown in Fig. 9.84. The tip of the vector L traces out a circle in a
horizontal plane with frequency ω. The radius of this circle is the horizontal component
of L, which is L⊥ ≡ L cos θ . The rate of change of L therefore has magnitude

Remarks: For θ → 0, this goes to zero, which makes sense. For θ → π/2, it goes to
the finite value m(cid:2)ω2/12, which isn’t so obvious. The lever arm and |dL/dt| are both
small in this limit, and they happen to be proportional to each other as they both head
to zero.

Note that if we instead had a massless stick with equal masses m/2 on the ends,
so that the relevant moment of inertia is now m(cid:2)2/4, then our answer would be T =
(1/4)m(cid:2)ω2 sin θ. This makes sense if we write it as T = (m/2) · ((cid:2)/2) sin θ · ω2,
because each tension is responsible for simply keeping a mass m/2 moving in a circle
of radius ((cid:2)/2) sin θ at frequency ω. This simple force argument doesn’t work for the
original stick because of internal forces in the stick. ♣

9.11. Stick under a ring

As in Problem 9.10, the angular momentum around the CM can be found by breaking
ω up into its components along the principal axes of the stick. The reasoning is exactly
the same, so the angular momentum at any time has magnitude

component. This has length L cos θ and travels in a circle at frequency ω. Hence,
|dL/dt| = ωL cos θ, and it is directed into the page at the instant shown.

The torque around the CM has magnitude mg((cid:2)/2) sin θ , and it points into the page at
the instant shown. (This torque arises from the vertical force from the ring. There is no
horizontal force from the ring, because the CM does not move.) Therefore, τ = dL/dt

can check. But see Exercise 9.45 for a related setup.

3. Since the middle of the stick is motionless, you might be tempted to treat the
bottom half as the stick in the example in Section 9.4.2. That is, you might just
want to plug in (cid:2)/2 as the length in Eq. (9.38). This, however, does not yield the
answer in Eq. (9.125). The error is that there are internal forces in the stick that
provide torques. If a pivot were placed at the CM of the stick (connecting the two
halves) in this problem, then the stick would not remain straight.

4. If we replace the stick by a massless string with equal masses m/2 on the ends,
2g/((cid:2) cos θ ).
then the relevant moment of inertia is m(cid:2)2/4, and we obtain ω =
(cid:4)
This is in fact simply the ω =
g/[((cid:2)/2) cos θ ] answer for a point-mass circular
pendulum of length (cid:2)/2 (see Problem 9.12), because the middle of the string
is motionless, and because the flexible string can’t provide the internal torques
mentioned in the previous paragraph. ♣

(a) The forces on the mass are gravity and the force from the rod (the tension), which
points along the rod (see Fig. 9.86).29 Since there is no vertical acceleration,
we have T cos θ = mg. The unbalanced horizontal force from the tension is
therefore T sin θ = mg tan θ . This force accounts for the centripetal acceleration,
m((cid:2) sin θ)(cid:18)2. Hence,

(cid:1)

(cid:18) =

g
(cid:2) cos θ .
For θ ≈ 0, this is the same as the
g/(cid:2) frequency for a simple pendulum.
For θ ≈ π/2, it goes to infinity, which makes sense. Note that θ must be less
than π/2 for circular motion to be possible. (This restriction doesn’t hold for a
spinning top with extended mass.)

(9.126)

√

(b) The only force that applies a torque relative to the pivot is the gravitational force,
so the torque is τ = mg(cid:2) sin θ , directed into the page at the instant shown in
Fig. 9.87.

At this moment, the mass has a speed ((cid:2) sin θ )(cid:18), directed into the page.
Therefore, L = r × p has magnitude m(cid:2)2(cid:18) sin θ and is directed upward to the
right, as shown. The tip of L traces out a circle of radius L cos θ , at frequency (cid:18).
Therefore, dL/dt has magnitude (cid:18)L cos θ and is directed into the page. Hence,
τ = dL/dt gives mg(cid:2) sin θ = (cid:18)(m(cid:2)2(cid:18) sin θ ) cos θ , which yields Eq. (9.126).
(c) The only force that applies a torque relative to the mass is the force from the pivot,
which has two components (see Fig. 9.88). The vertical piece is mg. Relative to
the mass, this provides a torque of mg((cid:2) sin θ ), directed into the page. There is
also the horizontal piece, which accounts for the centripetal acceleration of the
mass, so it equals m((cid:2) sin θ )(cid:18)2. Relative to the mass, this provides a torque of
m(cid:2) sin θ (cid:18)2((cid:2) cos θ ), directed out of the page.

Relative to the mass, there is no angular momentum. Therefore, dL/dt = 0,
and so there must be no torque. This means that the above two torques must
cancel, which gives mg((cid:2) sin θ ) = m(cid:2) sin θ (cid:18)2((cid:2) cos θ ). This yields Eq. (9.126).
In problems that are more complicated than this one, it is often easier to work
with the fixed pivot (if there is one) as the origin, instead of the CM, because
then you don’t have to worry about the messy pivot forces contributing to the
torque.

9.13. Rolling in a cone

=

0

L

The forces on the ring are gravity (mg), the normal force (N ) from the cone, and the
friction force (F) pointing up along the cone (or perhaps down along the cone if F
turns out to be negative, but we’ll find that it won’t). Since there is no net force in the
vertical direction, we have

N sin θ + F cos θ = mg.

(9.127)

The inward horizontal force accounts for the centripetal acceleration, which gives

N cos θ − F sin θ = m(h tan θ )(cid:18)2.

Solving the previous two equations for F gives

F = mg cos θ − m(cid:18)2(h tan θ ) sin θ ,

(9.128)

(9.129)

29 The force from the rod must point along the rod because it is massless. If there were a tangential
force on the mass, then Newton’s third law would say that there would also be a tangential force
on the rod. This would then produce a nonzero torque on the rod (relative to the pivot) and hence
an infinite angular acceleration, because there is no gravitational torque on the (massless) rod to
counter it.

with upward along the cone taken to be positive (this is just a rearrangement of the
F = ma equation along the cone). The torque on the ring (relative to its CM) is due
only to this F, because gravity provides no torque, and N points though the center of
the ring (by the second assumption in the problem). Therefore, the torque points out
of the page with magnitude

We must now find dL/dt. Since we are assuming r (cid:4) h tan θ , the frequency of the
spinning of the ring (call it ω) is much greater than the frequency of precession, (cid:18).
We will therefore neglect the latter in finding L. In this approximation, L (relative
to the CM) has magnitude mr2ω, and it points downward along the cone (for the
direction of motion shown in Fig. 9.45). The horizontal component of L has magnitude
L⊥ ≡ L sin θ, and it traces out a circle at frequency (cid:18). Therefore, dL/dt points out of
the page with magnitude

If you consider an object with moment of inertia βmr2 (our ring has β = 1),

then you can show by the above reasoning that the “2” in Eq. (9.133) is replaced by
(1 + β). This means that if we instead have a particle sliding around a frictionless cone

(which is equivalent to a ring with β = 0), then the frequency is

9.14. Tennis racket theorem

Rotation around ˆx1: If the racket is rotated (nearly) around the ˆx1 axis, then the initial
ω2 and ω3 are much smaller than ω1. To emphasize this, let’s relabel them as ω2 → (cid:9)2
and ω3 → (cid:9)3. Then Eq. (9.45) becomes (with the torque equal to zero, because gravity
provides no torque around the CM)

0 = ˙ω1 − A(cid:9)2(cid:9)3,
0 = ˙(cid:9)2 + Bω1(cid:9)3,
0 = ˙(cid:9)3 − Cω1(cid:9)2,

where we have defined (for convenience)

A ≡ I2 − I3

(9.134)

(9.135)

Note that A, B, and C are all positive. This fact will be very important.

Our goal here is to show that if the (cid:9)’s start out small, then they remain small.
Assuming that they are small (which is true initially), the first equation says that

30 This is technically not quite correct, for the same reason that the earth spins around 366 times

instead of 365 times in a year. But it’s valid enough in the limit of small r.

438

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

˙ω1 ≈ 0, to first order in the (cid:9)’s. Therefore, we may assume that ω1 is essentially
constant (when the (cid:9)’s are small). Taking the derivative of the second equation then
gives 0 = ¨(cid:9)2 + Bω1 ˙(cid:9)3. Plugging the value of ˙(cid:9)3 from the third equation into this yields
(cid:7)

(cid:8)

¨(cid:9)2 = −

BCω2
1

(cid:9)2.

(9.136)

Because of the negative coefficient on the right-hand side, this equation describes
simple harmonic motion. Therefore, (cid:9)2 oscillates sinusoidally around zero. So if it
starts small, it remains small. By the same reasoning, (cid:9)3 remains small.

We therefore see that ω ≈ (ω1, 0, 0) at all times, which implies that L ≈ (I1ω1, 0, 0)
at all times. That is, L always points (nearly) along the ˆx1 direction (which is fixed
in the racket frame). But the direction of L is fixed in the lab frame, because there is
no torque. Therefore, the direction of ˆx1 must also be (nearly) fixed in the lab frame.
In other words, the racket doesn’t wobble.

Rotation around ˆx3: This calculation goes through exactly as above, except with “1”
and “3” interchanged. We find that if (cid:9)1 and (cid:9)2 start small, they remain small.

If the racket is rotated (nearly) around the ˆx2 axis, then the
Rotation around ˆx2:
initial ω1 and ω3 are much smaller than ω2. As above, let’s emphasize this by relabeling
them as ω1 → (cid:9)1 and ω3 → (cid:9)3. Then as above, Eq. (9.45) becomes

0 = ˙(cid:9)1 − Aω2(cid:9)3,
0 = ˙ω2 + B(cid:9)1(cid:9)3,
0 = ˙(cid:9)3 − Cω2(cid:9)1.

(9.137)

Our goal here is to show that if the (cid:9)’s start out small, then they do not remain small.
Assuming that they are small (which is true initially), the second equation says that
˙ω2 ≈ 0, to first order in the (cid:9)’s. So we may assume that ω2 is essentially constant (when
the (cid:9)’s are small). Taking the derivative of the first equation then gives 0 = ¨(cid:9)1 −Aω2 ˙(cid:9)3.
Plugging the value of ˙(cid:9)3 from the third equation into this yields

(cid:7)

(cid:8)

¨(cid:9)1 =

ACω2
2

(cid:9)1.

(9.138)

Because of the positive coefficient on the right-hand side, this equation describes
an exponentially growing motion, instead of an oscillatory one. Therefore, (cid:9)1 grows
quickly from its initial small value. So even if it starts small, it becomes large. By
the same reasoning, (cid:9)3 becomes large. Of course, once the (cid:9)’s become large, then
our assumption of ˙ω2 ≈ 0 isn’t valid anymore. But once the (cid:9)’s become large, we’ve
shown what we wanted to.

We see that ω does not remain (nearly) equal to (0, ω2, 0), which implies that L
does not remain (nearly) equal to (0, I2ω2, 0). That is, L does not always point (nearly)
along the ˆx2 direction (which is fixed in the racket frame). But the direction of L is
fixed in the lab frame, because there is no torque. Therefore, the direction of ˆx2 must
change in the lab frame. In other words, the racket wobbles.

9.15. Free-top angles

In terms of the principal axes, ˆx1, ˆx2, ˆx3, we have

ω = (ω1 ˆx1 + ω2 ˆx2) + ω3 ˆx3,
L = I (ω1 ˆx1 + ω2 ˆx2) + I3ω3 ˆx3.

and

(9.139)

Let ω⊥ ˆω⊥ ≡ (ω1 ˆx1 + ω2 ˆx2) be the component of ω orthogonal to ω3. Then we have

If I > I3, then α > β, and we have the situation shown in Fig. 9.89. A top with this
property is called a “prolate top.” An example is an American football or a pencil.

If I < I3, then α < β, and we have the situation shown in Fig. 9.90. A top with this

property is called an “oblate top.” An example is a coin or a Frisbee.

9.16. Staying above

If I < I3 (oblate top), then the initial ˆx3, ω, and L vectors look like those in Fig. 9.91,
with L between ˆx3 and ω. The ω vector traces out a cone around L as shown, so it
always stays above the horizontal (because it starts above the horizontal).

However, if I > I3 (prolate top), then the initial ˆx3, ω, and L vectors look like those
in Fig. 9.92, with ω between ˆx3 and L. Depending on the values of I /I3 and ω⊥/ω3
(where ω⊥ is the component of ω orthogonal to ˆx3), the ω cone might stay above the
horizontal axis, or it might dip below it. We are concerned with the cutoff case where
it just touches the axis, as shown.

From Fig. 9.92, the half-angle of the cone is α − β, so if the cone reaches down to

the horizontal axis, then we have α + (α − β) = 90◦. But α and β are given by

tan β =

(9.144)

We see that if n ≤ 2, there is no solution for x. But if n > 2, there is a solution.
Therefore, the answer to the problem is n = 2.

Remarks:
If n is only slightly larger than 2, then the solution for x in Eq. (9.144) (and
hence ω⊥) is large. This means that your strike needs to be large, in order to produce
a large ω⊥.

There are three interesting limits of what can happen in the large-n limit, so let’s
list them out. For these three cases, picture a thin stick spinning around its vertical x3
axis, and then imagine striking the bottom end with different impulses.

• If ω⊥ (cid:4) ω3 and L⊥ (cid:4) L3, then both ω and L point nearly straight upwards, so
ω traces out a very thin cone around L and is always nearly vertical. ˆx3 is also
always nearly vertical.

• If ω⊥ (cid:4) ω3 but L⊥ (cid:6) L3 (which is possible if n is sufficiently large), then ω
points nearly straight upwards initially, whereas L points nearly horizontally. So
ω traces out a very wide cone and swings down almost to the negative vertical
direction. ˆx3 also traces out a very wide cone.

• If ω⊥ (cid:6) ω3, which implies L⊥ (cid:6) L3, then both ω and L point nearly horizon-
tally, so ω traces out a very thin cone around L and is always nearly horizontal.

ˆx3 still traces out a very wide cone, because it starts vertical (by assumption),
independent of where ω and L are. Note that your eye can’t distinguish between the
second and third cases here, because the ˆx3 axis is doing the same thing in both
cases. ♣

9.17. The top

(a) In order for there to exist real solutions for (cid:18) in Eq. (9.82), the discriminant
must be non-negative. If θ > π/2, then cos θ < 0, so the discriminant is
automatically positive, and any value of ω3 is allowed. But if θ < π/2, then the
lower limit on ω3 is

√

ω3 ≥

4MIg(cid:2) cos θ
I3
The special case of θ = π/2 requires a limit to be taken; it turns out that there is
only one (noninfinite) solution, as we’ll see in part (b). Note that at the critical
value of ω3 in Eq. (9.145), Eq. (9.82) gives

≡ ˜ω3.

(9.145)

(cid:18)+ = (cid:18)− = I3 ˜ω3

mean is that the fraction in the square root in Eq. (9.82) is very small compared

and (cid:18)− ≈ Mg(cid:2)

(9.148)

These are known as the “fast” and “slow” frequencies of precession, respectively.
(cid:18)− is the approximate answer we found in Eq. (9.77). It was obtained here under
the assumption (cid:9) (cid:4) 1, which is equivalent to

√

ω3 (cid:6)

4MIg(cid:2) cos θ
I3

(that is, ω3 (cid:6) ˜ω3).

(9.149)

This, therefore, is the condition for the result in Eq. (9.77) to be a good approx-
imation. If I is of the same order as I3, so that they are both of order M (cid:2)2
(assuming that the top is a reasonably shaped object without any strange tails),
and if cos θ is of order 1, then this condition can be written as ω3 (cid:6)
g/(cid:2),
which is the frequency of a pendulum of length (cid:2).

√

Remarks:

1. The (cid:18)+ solution is a fairly surprising result. Two strange features of (cid:18)+ are
that it grows with ω3, and that it is independent of g. To see what is going
on with this precession, note that (cid:18)+ is the value of (cid:18) that makes the L⊥
in Eq. (9.79) essentially equal to zero. So L points nearly along the vertical
axis. The rate of change of L is the product of a very small horizontal radius
(of the tiny circle the tip traces out) and a very large (cid:18) (assuming that ω3 is
large). The product of these equals the “medium sized” torque, Mg(cid:2) sin θ .
2. In the limit of large ω3, the fast precession should look basically like the
motion of a free top, because the L here points essentially in a fixed direc-
tion, just as it does for a free top. And indeed, (cid:18)+ is independent of g. More

9.10 Solutions

441

precisely, we can see that the value of (cid:18)+ given in Eq. (9.148) agrees with
the free-top precession frequency, by the following reasoning. I3ω3 is the
component of L along the symmetry axis, which makes an angle θ with the
vertical (which is essentially the direction of L). Therefore, L has magni-
tude L ≈ I3ω3/ cos θ, which means we can write (cid:18)+ ≈ L/I . This is the
precession frequency of a free top, given in Eq. (9.55), as viewed from a
fixed frame.

3. We can plot the (cid:18)± in Eq. (9.82) as functions of ω3. With the definitions of

˜ω3 and (cid:18)0 in Eqs. (9.145) and (9.146), we can rewrite Eq. (9.82) as

Si

Fig. 9.94

The system is made up of N rigid bodies, each consisting of a disk and a massless stick
glued to it on its left (see Fig. 9.94). Label these subsystems as Si, with S1 being the
one closest to the pole. Let each disk have mass m and moment of inertia I , and let each
stick have length (cid:2). Let the angular speeds be ωi. The relevant angular momentum of
Si is then Li = I ωi, and it points horizontally.31 Let the desired precession frequency
be (cid:18). Then dLi/dt has magnitude Li(cid:18) = (I ωi)(cid:18) and points into the page at the instant
shown in Fig. 9.49.

Consider the torque τi on Si, around its CM. Let’s first look at S1. The pole provides
an upward force of Nmg (this force is what keeps all the tops up), so it provides a torque
of Nmg(cid:2) (into the page) around the CM of S1. The downward force from the stick on
the right provides no torque around the CM, because it acts at the CM. Likewise, the
gravitational force on S1 provides no torque around the CM. Therefore, τ1 = dL1/dt
gives Nmg(cid:2) = (I ω1)(cid:18), and so

ω1 = Nmg(cid:2)
I (cid:18) .
Now look at S2. S1 provides an upward force of (N − 1)mg (this force is what keeps S2
through SN up), so it provides a torque of (N − 1)mg(cid:2) around the CM of S2. As with
S1, this is the only torque on S2. Therefore, τ2 = dL2/dt gives (N −1)mg(cid:2) = (I ω2)(cid:18),
and so

(9.152)

ω2 =

(N − 1)mg(cid:2)
I (cid:18)

.

Similar reasoning applies to the other Si, so we arrive at

ωi =

(N + 1 − i)mg(cid:2)
I (cid:18)

.

The ωi are therefore in the ratio

(9.154)

ω1 : ω2 : · · · : ωN −1 : ωN = N : (N − 1) : · · · : 2 : 1.

(9.155)

31 We’re ignoring the angular momentum arising from the precession. This part of L points vertically
(because the tops all point horizontally) and therefore doesn’t change. Hence, it doesn’t enter into
τ = dL/dt.

442

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

Note that we needed to apply τ = dL/dt many times, using each CM as the origin.
Using only the pivot point on the pole as the origin would have given us only one piece
of information, whereas we needed N pieces.

Remarks: As a double-check, we can verify that the above ω’s make τ = dL/dt true,
where τ and L are the total torque and angular momentum relative to the pivot on the
pole. The CM of the entire system is (N + 1)(cid:2)/2 from the pole, so the torque due to
gravity is

τ = Nmg

We can also pose this problem for the setup where all the ωi are equal (call them
ω), and the goal is to find the lengths of the sticks that allow circular precession with
the sticks always forming a straight horizontal line. We can use the same reasoning as
above, and Eq. (9.154) takes the modified form

ω =

(N + 1 − i)mg(cid:2)i

(9.158)

where (cid:2)i is the length of the ith stick. Therefore, the (cid:2)i are in the ratio

Again, we can verify that these (cid:2)’s make τ = dL/dt true, where τ and L are the total
torque and angular momentum relative to the pivot on the pole. As an exercise, you
can show that the CM happens to be a distance (cid:2)N from the pole. So the torque due to
gravity is, using Eq. (9.158) to obtain (cid:2)N ,

τ = Nmg(cid:2)N = Nmg(ωI (cid:18)/mg) = NI ω(cid:18).

(9.160)

The total angular momentum is simply L = NI ω. So indeed, τ = L(cid:18) = |dL/dt|. Note
1/n diverges, it is possible to make the setup extend arbitrarily
that since the sum
far from the pole. ♣

9.19. Heavy top on a slippery table

In Section 9.7.3, we looked at τ and L relative to the pivot point. Such quantities are
of no use now, because the pivot is accelerating, so it isn’t a legal choice of origin for
applying τ = dL/dt. We will therefore look at τ and L relative to the CM, which is
always a legal origin for applying τ = dL/dt.

With the CM as our origin, there are two modifications we need to make to the
derivation in Section 9.7.3. First, the moments of inertia are now measured with
respect to the CM, instead of the pivot point. I3 is unchanged, but the parallel-axis
theorem gives the new I as

(cid:16) ≡ I − M (cid:2)2.

Second, the torque is modified. The only force from the frictionless floor is the normal
force N . But N is not necessarily equal to Mg, because the CM may be accelerating
in the vertical direction. The vertical F = ma equation is N − Mg = M ¨y, where y =
(cid:2) cos θ . Taking the second derivative of y, we obtain N = Mg −M (cid:2)( ¨θ sin θ + ˙θ 2 cos θ ).
The torque relative to the CM therefore has magnitude

τ = N (cid:2) sin θ = Mg(cid:2) sin θ − M (cid:2)2 sin θ( ¨θ sin θ + ˙θ 2 cos θ ),

(9.162)

and it points in the same direction as in Section 9.7.3. Putting everything together, we
see that Eq. (9.69) is unchanged, Eq. (9.70) has I replaced with I (cid:16) ≡ I − M (cid:2)2, and the
second of Eqs. (9.70) also has an extra term and becomes

(cid:7)

Mg(cid:2) − M (cid:2)2( ¨θ sin θ + ˙θ 2 cos θ) + I

(cid:16) ˙φ2 cos θ − I3ω3

˙φ

(cid:8)

sin θ = I ¨θ .

(9.163)

Note that if ˙θ ≡ 0, the only modification needed is the change in I .

If you prefer to use the Lagrangian method in Section 9.7.4, then I needs to be
changed to I (cid:16) as above, and the other modification comes in the kinetic energy in the
Lagrangian. We must add on the kinetic energy of the whole object treated like a point
mass at the CM, because so far we have included only the kinetic energy relative to our
new origin (the CM). Since the table is frictionless, the CM can move only vertically,
so its velocity is ˙y = −(cid:2) ˙θ sin θ. Therefore, we have to add the term M ((cid:2) ˙θ sin θ )2/2 to
the Lagrangian. You can show that this leads to the extra term in Eq. (9.163).

9.20. Fixed highest point

For the desired motion with P always the highest point, the important thing to note is
that every point in the top moves in a fixed circle around the ˆz axis. Therefore, ω points
vertically at all times. Hence, if (cid:18) is the frequency of precession, we have ω = (cid:18)ˆz.

Another way to see that ω points vertically is to view things in the frame that rotates
with angular velocity (cid:18)ˆz. In this frame, the top has no motion at all. It isn’t even
spinning, because the point P is always the highest point. In the language of Fig. 9.30,
we therefore have ω(cid:16) = 0, so ω = (cid:18)ˆz + ω(cid:16) ˆx3 = (cid:18)ˆz.

The principal moments are (with the pivot as the origin; see Fig. 9.95)

where we have used the parallel-axis theorem in finding I . The components of ω along
the principal axes are ω3 = (cid:18) cos θ and ω2 = (cid:18) sin θ . Therefore (keeping things in
terms of the general moments, I3 and I , for now),

L = I3(cid:18) cos θ ˆx3 + I (cid:18) sin θ ˆx2.

Fig. 9.95

The horizontal component of L is then L⊥ = (I3(cid:18) cos θ ) sin θ − (I (cid:18) sin θ ) cos θ , so

must equal the torque, which has magnitude |τ| = Mg(cid:2) sin θ and is directed into the
page. Therefore,

(cid:18) =

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

We see that for a general symmetric top, the desired precessional motion (where the
same “side” always points up) is possible only if the product (I3 − I ) cos θ is greater
than zero. That is,

θ < π/2 =⇒ I3 > I ,
θ > π/2 =⇒ I3 < I .

For the problem at hand, I3 and I are given in Eq. (9.164), so we find

(cid:13)

(cid:18) =

4g(cid:2)
(R2 − 4(cid:2)2) cos θ .

(9.168)

(9.169)

The necessary condition for such motion to exist is therefore R > 2(cid:2) if θ < π/2, or
R < 2(cid:2) if θ > π/2.

Remarks:

1. It is intuitively clear that (cid:18) should become very large as θ → π/2, although it
is by no means intuitively clear that such motion should exist at all for angles
near π/2.

2. If θ > π/2 and R = 0, we simply have the circular pendulum discussed in
Problem 9.12. And indeed, when R = 0, the result in Eq. (9.169) reduces to
g/(cid:2) cos α, where α ≡ π − θ , which agrees with the result in Eq. (9.126).
(cid:18) =
3. (cid:18) approaches a nonzero constant as θ → 0 or θ → π (depending on the sign of

√

I3 − I ), which isn’t entirely obvious.

4. If both R and (cid:2) are scaled up by the same factor, Eq. (9.169) shows that (cid:18)

decreases. This also follows from dimensional analysis.

5. Assuming that θ < π/2 (the θ > π/2 case can be handled in a similar manner),
the condition I3 > I can be understood in the following way. If I3 = I , then
L ∝ ω, so L points vertically along ω. If I3 > I , then L points somewhere
to the right of the z axis (at the instant shown in Fig. 9.95). This means that
the tip of L is moving into the page, along with the top. This is what we need,
because τ points into the page. If, however, I3 < I , then L points somewhere
to the left of the z axis, so dL/dt points out of the page, and hence cannot be
equal to τ. ♣

9.21. Basketball on a rim

Assume that the precessional motion is counterclockwise when viewed from above,
as indicated in Fig. 9.52. Let’s look at things in the frame that has the center of the
rim as its origin and that rotates with angular velocity (cid:18)ˆz. In this frame, the center
of the ball is at rest, and the rim spins clockwise with angular speed (cid:18). If the contact
points are to form a great circle on the ball, the ball must be spinning around the
(negative) ˆx3 axis shown in Fig. 9.96. Let the frequency of this spinning be ω(cid:16) (in the
language of Fig. 9.30). Then the nonslipping condition says that ω(cid:16)r = (cid:18)R, and so
ω(cid:16) = (cid:18)R/r. Therefore, the total angular velocity of the ball with respect to the lab
frame is

ω = (cid:18)ˆz − ω(cid:16) ˆx3 = (cid:18)ˆz − (R/r)(cid:18)ˆx3.

(9.170)

Let us choose the center of the ball as the origin around which we calculate τ and L.
Then every axis in the ball is a principal axis with moment of inertia I = (2/3)mr2.
The angular momentum is therefore

L = I ω = I (cid:18)ˆz − I (R/r)(cid:18)ˆx3.

and it points out of the page.

The torque (relative to the center of the ball) comes from the force at the contact
point. There are two components to this force. The vertical component is mg, and the
horizontal component is m(R − r cos θ)(cid:18)2 (pointing to the left), because the center of
the ball moves in a circle of radius (R − r cos θ). The torque therefore has magnitude

|τ| = mg(r cos θ) − m(R − r cos θ )(cid:18)2(r sin θ ),

(9.173)

with out of the page taken to be positive. Equating this |τ| with the |dL/dt| in Eq. (9.172)
gives

(cid:18)2 =

3 R tan θ − r sin θ

(9.174)

Remarks:

1. (cid:18) → ∞ as θ → 0, which makes sense. And (cid:18) → 0 as θ → π/2, which also

makes sense.

2. (cid:18) → ∞ when R = (3/5)r cos θ. But this isn’t physical, because we must have

R > r cos θ in order for the other side of the rim to be outside the ball.

3. You can also work out the problem for the case where the contact points trace out
a circle other than a great circle (say, one that is inclined at an angle β below the
great circle). The expression for the torque in Eq. (9.173) is unchanged, but the
value of ω(cid:16) and the angle of the ˆx3 axis both change, so Eq. (9.172) is modified.
If you want to play around with this, one thing you can show (with a bit of work)
is that if R (cid:6) r and if you want the ball to travel around the rim infinitely fast,
then β must equal tan−1((5/2) tan θ). This is larger than θ , so the contact-point
circle actually lies below the horizontal. ♣

9.22. Rolling lollipop

We must first find the angular velocity vector ω. Assume that the precessional motion
is clockwise when viewed from above, as indicated in Fig. 9.53. We claim that ω points
horizontally to the right (at the instant shown in Fig. 9.97), with magnitude (R/r)(cid:18).
This can be seen in two ways.

The first way is to recognize that we essentially have the same scenario as in the
“Rolling cone” setup of Problem 9.3 (imagine the sphere to be a ball of ice cream in a
cone whose tip is located at the left end of the stick). The sphere’s contact point with the
ground is instantaneously at rest (the nonslipping condition), so ω must pass through
this point. But ω must also pass through the left end of the stick, because that point is
also at rest. Therefore, ω must be horizontal. To find the magnitude, note that the center
of the sphere moves with speed (cid:18)R. But since the center may also be considered to be
instantaneously moving with frequency ω in a circle of radius r around the horizontal
axis, we have ωr = (cid:18)R. Therefore, ω = (R/r)(cid:18).

The second way is to write ω as ω = −(cid:18)ˆz + ω(cid:16) ˆx3 (in the language of Fig. 9.30),
where ω(cid:16) is the frequency of the spinning as viewed by someone rotating around the
(negative) ˆz axis with frequency (cid:18). The contact points form a circle of radius R on
the ground. But they also form a circle of radius r cos θ on the sphere, where θ is the
angle between the stick and the ground (this circle is the circle of points where the

above-mentioned ice cream cone touches the sphere). The nonslipping condition then
implies that (cid:18)R = ω(cid:16)(r cos θ ). Therefore, ω(cid:16) = (cid:18)R/(r cos θ ), and so
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(cos θ ˆx + sin θ ˆz) = (R/r)(cid:18)ˆx,

ω = −(cid:18)ˆz + ω(cid:16) ˆx3 = −(cid:18)ˆz +

where we have used tan θ = r/R.

(cid:18)R
r cos θ

Now let’s calculate the normal force. Choose the pivot as the origin. The principal
axes are then ˆx3 along the stick, along with any two directions orthogonal to the stick.
Choose ˆx2 to be in the plane of the paper (see Fig. 9.97). Then the components of ω
along the principal axes are

ω3 = (R/r)(cid:18) cos θ ,

and ω2 = −(R/r)(cid:18) sin θ .

(9.176)

The principal moments are

I3 = (2/5)mr2,

and

I2 = (2/5)mr2 + m(r2 + R2),

(9.177)

where we have used the parallel-axis theorem. The angular momentum is L =
I3ω3 ˆx3 +I2ω2 ˆx2, so its horizontal component has length L⊥ = I3ω3 cos θ −I2ω2 sin θ .
Therefore, the magnitude of dL/dt is

The torque (relative to the pivot) is due to the gravitational force acting at the CM,
along with the normal force N acting at the contact point. (Any horizontal friction
that happens to exist at the contact point produces zero torque relative to the pivot.)
Therefore, τ points out of the page with magnitude |τ| = (N − mg)R. Equating this
with the |dL/dt| in Eq. (9.178) gives

N = mg + 7

mr(cid:18)2.

(9.179)

This has the interesting property of being independent of R, and hence also θ . This
independence arises because both |τ| and |dL/dt| are proportional to R, a fact which
is easier to see via the reasoning in the first remark below.

Remarks:

1. There is actually a quicker way to calculate the dL/dt in Eq. (9.178). At a given
instant, the sphere is rotating around the horizontal x axis with frequency ω =
(R/r)(cid:18). The moment of inertia around this axis is Ix = (7/5)mr2, from the
parallel-axis theorem. Therefore, the horizontal component of L has magnitude
Lx = Ixω = (7/5)mrR(cid:18). Multiplying this by the frequency (namely (cid:18)) at which
L swings around the z axis gives the result for |dL/dt| in Eq. (9.178). There is
also a vertical component of L relative to the pivot, but this component doesn’t
change, so it doesn’t come into dL/dt. (The vertical component happens to equal
−mR2(cid:18). This can be obtained by realizing that the sphere behaves like a point

mass for the present purpose, or by using the inertia tensor relative to the pivot,
or by calculating Lz = I3ω3 sin θ + I2ω2 cos θ.)

2. The pivot must provide a downward force of N − mg = (7/5)mr(cid:18)2, to make the
net vertical force on the lollipop equal to zero. This result is slightly larger than
the mr(cid:18)2 result for the “sliding” setup in Exercise 9.53.

3. The sum of the horizontal forces at the pivot and the contact point must equal the
required centripetal force of mR(cid:18)2. But it is impossible to say how this force is
divided up, without being given more information. ♣

9.23. Rolling coin

Choose the CM as the origin. The principal axes are then ˆx2 and ˆx3 (as shown in
Fig. 9.98), along with ˆx1 pointing into the paper. Assume that the precessional motion
is counterclockwise when viewed from above, as indicated in Fig. 9.54. Let’s look
at things in the frame that has the center of the contact-point circle on the ground as
its origin, and that rotates with angular velocity (cid:18)ˆz. In this frame, the CM remains
fixed, and the coin rotates with frequency ω(cid:16) (in the language of Fig. 9.30) around
the negative ˆx3 axis. The nonslipping condition then says that ω(cid:16)r = (cid:18)R, and so
ω(cid:16) = (cid:18)R/r. Therefore, the total angular velocity of the coin with respect to the lab
frame is

ω = (cid:18)ˆz − ω(cid:16) ˆx3 = (cid:18)ˆz − (R/r)(cid:18)ˆx3.

The torque (relative to the CM) comes from the force at the contact point. There are two
components to this force. The vertical component is mg, and the horizontal component
is m(R − r cos θ)(cid:18)2 leftward, because the CM moves in a circle of radius (R − r cos θ ).
The torque therefore has magnitude

|τ| = mg(r cos θ) − m(R − r cos θ )(cid:18)2(r sin θ ),

(9.186)

Remarks:

1. For θ → π/2, Eq. (9.185) gives (cid:18) → 0, as it should. And for θ → 0, we obtain

(cid:18) → ∞, which also makes sense.

2. For r cos θ > R > (5/6)r cos θ , the CM of the coin lies to the left of the center
of the contact-point circle (at the instant shown). The centripetal force, m(R −
r cos θ)(cid:18)2, is therefore negative (which means that it is directed radially outward,
to the right), but the motion is still possible. As R gets close to (5/6)r cos θ , the
frequency (cid:18) goes to infinity, which means that the radially outward force also
goes to infinity. The coefficient of friction between the coin and the ground must
therefore be correspondingly large.

3. We can consider a more general coin, whose density depends only on the distance
from the center, and whose I3 equals βmr2. For example, a uniform coin has
β = 1/2, and a coin with all its mass on the edge has β = 1. By the perpendicular-
axis theorem, I1 = I2 = (1/2)βmr2, and you can show that the above methods
yield

(cid:18)2 =

The larger β is, the smaller the lower bound on R is. But even if β → ∞ (imagine
long radial spokes attached to the coin, and eliminate the ground except for the
ring of contact points, so it doesn’t get in the way), R still can’t be any smaller
than (r/2) cos θ . ♣

9.24. Wobbling coin

(a) Choose the CM as the origin. The principal axes are then ˆx2 and ˆx3 (as shown
in Fig. 9.99), along with ˆx1 pointing into the paper. Assume that the preces-
sional motion is counterclockwise when viewed from above, as indicated in
Fig. 9.55. Consider the setup in the frame rotating with angular velocity (cid:18)ˆz.
In this frame, the location of the contact point remains fixed, and the coin
rotates with frequency ω(cid:16) (in the language of Fig. 9.30) around the negative
ˆx3 axis. The radius of the circle of contact points on the table is R cos θ .
Therefore, the nonslipping condition says that ω(cid:16)R = (cid:18)(R cos θ ), and so
ω(cid:16) = (cid:18) cos θ. Hence, the total angular velocity of the coin with respect to the lab
frame is

ω = (cid:18)ˆz − ω(cid:16) ˆx3 = (cid:18)(sin θ ˆx2 + cos θ ˆx3) − ((cid:18) cos θ )ˆx3 = (cid:18) sin θ ˆx2.

(9.188)

In retrospect, it makes sense that ω must point in the ˆx2 direction. Both the CM
and the instantaneous contact point on the coin are at rest, so ω must lie along
the line containing these two points, that is, along the ˆx2 axis.

(b) The principal moment around the ˆx2 axis is I = mR2/4. The angular momen-
tum is L = I ω2 ˆx2, so its horizontal component has length L⊥ = L cos θ =
(I ω2) cos θ. Therefore, dL/dt has magnitude

The torque (relative to the CM) is due to the normal force at the contact
point. This normal force is essentially equal to mg, because the CM is assumed
to be falling very slowly. Note that there is no sideways friction force at the
contact point, because the CM is essentially motionless. The torque therefore
has magnitude

|τ| = mgR cos θ ,

g/R as θ → π/2, which isn’t so obvious. In this case, L points
nearly vertically, and it traces out a tiny cone due to a tiny torque. In
this θ → π/2 limit, (cid:18) is also the frequency at which the plane of the
coin spins around the vertical axis. If you spin a coin very fast about a
vertical diameter, it initially undergoes a purely spinning motion with only
one contact point. But then it gradually loses energy due to friction, until
g/R, at which point it begins to
the spinning frequency slows down to 2
wobble (we’re assuming that the coin is very thin, so that it can’t balance on
its edge). In the case where the coin is a US quarter (with R ≈ 0.012 m),
g/R turns out to be (cid:18) ≈ 57 rad/s, which
this critical frequency of 2
corresponds to about 9 Hz.

of Problem 9.23. The CM of the coin in Problem 9.23 is motionless
if R = r cos θ. Plugging this into Eq. (9.185) gives (cid:18)2 = 4g/(r sin θ ),
which agrees with Eq. (9.191), because r was the coin’s radius in
Problem 9.23. ♣

(c) Consider one revolution of the contact point around the z axis. Since the radius
of the circle on the table is R cos θ, the contact point moves a distance 2πR cos θ
around the coin during this time. Hence, the new contact point on the coin is
a distance 2πR − 2πR cos θ away from the original contact point. The coin
therefore appears to have rotated by a fraction (1 − cos θ ) of a full turn during
this time. The frequency with which you see it turn is therefore

(1 − cos θ)(cid:18) = 2(1 − cos θ )

(cid:1)

R sin θ .

(9.192)

Remarks:

1. If θ ≈ π/2, then the frequency of Abe’s rotation is essentially equal to (cid:18).
This makes sense, because the top of Abe’s head will be, say, always near
the top of the coin, and this point will trace out a small circle around the z
axis, with nearly the same frequency as the contact point.

2. As θ → 0, Abe appears to rotate with frequency θ 3/2

g/R (using sin θ ≈ θ
and cos θ ≈ 1−θ 2/2). Therefore, although the contact point moves infinitely
quickly in this limit, we nevertheless see Abe rotating very slowly, as you
can experimentally verify.
√

3. All of the results for frequencies in this problem must be some multiple of
g/R, by dimensional analysis. But whether the multiplication factor is

√

zero, infinite, or something in between, is not at all obvious.

4. An incorrect answer for the frequency of Abe’s turning (when viewed
from above) is that it equals the vertical component of ω, which is

450

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

√

ωz = ω sin θ = ((cid:18) sin θ ) sin θ = 2(sin θ )3/2
g/R. This does not equal the
result in Eq. (9.192). (It agrees at θ = π/2 but is off by a factor of 2 for
θ → 0.) This answer is incorrect because there is simply no reason why the
vertical component of ω should equal the frequency of revolution of, say,
Abe’s nose, around the vertical axis. For example, at moments when ω passes
through the nose, then the nose isn’t moving at all, so it certainly cannot be
described as moving around the vertical axis with frequency ωz = ω sin θ .
The result in Eq. (9.192) is a sort of average measure of the frequency
of rotation. Even though any given point on the coin is not undergoing
uniform circular motion, your eye sees the coin essentially rotating uniformly
as a whole. ♣

9.25. Nutation cusps

(a) Because both ˙φ and ˙θ are continuous functions of time, we must have
˙φ = ˙θ = 0 at a kink. Otherwise, either dθ/dφ = ˙θ / ˙φ or dφ/dθ = ˙φ/ ˙θ
would be well defined at the kink. Let the kink occur at t = t0. Then the second
of Eqs. (9.92) gives sin(ωnt0) = 0. Therefore, cos(ωnt0) = ±1, and the first of
Eqs. (9.92) gives

(cid:16)(cid:18) = ∓(cid:18)s,

(9.193)

as desired. Note that if cos(ωnt0) = 1, then (cid:16)(cid:18) = −(cid:18)s, so Eq. (9.91) says that
the kink occurs at the smallest value of θ , that is, at the highest point of the top’s
motion. And if cos(ωnt0) = −1, then (cid:16)(cid:18) = (cid:18)s, so Eq. (9.91) again says that
the kink occurs at the highest point of the top’s motion. These results agree with
the (cid:16)(cid:18) = ±(cid:18)s plots in Fig. 9.38.

(b) To show that these kinks are cusps, we will show that the slope of the θ
vs. φ plot is infinite on either side of the kink. That is, we will show that
dθ/dφ = ˙θ/ ˙φ = ±∞. Consider the case where cos(ωnt0) = 1 and (cid:16)(cid:18) = −(cid:18)s
(the cos(ωnt0) = −1 case proceeds similarly). With (cid:16)(cid:18) = −(cid:18)s, Eq. (9.92)
gives

˙θ
˙φ

= sin θ0 sin ωnt
1 − cos ωnt

.

(9.194)

Let t = t0 + (cid:9). Using cos(ωnt0) = 1 and sin(ωnt0) = 0, and expanding
Eq. (9.194) to lowest order in (cid:9), we find

˙θ
˙φ

= sin θ0(ωn(cid:9))
(cid:9)2/2
ω2
n

= 2 sin θ0
ωn(cid:9)

.

(9.195)

For infinitesimal (cid:9), this switches from −∞ to +∞ as (cid:9) passes through zero.
The point here is that although both ˙θ and ˙φ go to zero, ˙φ goes quadratically,
whereas ˙θ goes only linearly.

9.26. Nutation circles

(a) In the limit ω3 (cid:6) (cid:18)s, the original L points essentially along the x3 direction,
with magnitude I3ω3. So it makes an angle of essentially θ0 with the vertical z
axis. Now consider the quick kick. If ˙φ (which is the angular speed around the
vertical z axis) suddenly increases by (cid:16)(cid:18), then this corresponds to a sudden
increase in angular speed around the x2 axis of sin θ0 (cid:16)(cid:18) (see Fig. 9.100). The
kick therefore produces an angular momentum component (relative to the pivot)
of I sin θ0 (cid:16)(cid:18) in the x2 direction. So from Fig. 9.100, the angle that the new L
makes with the z axis is (using (cid:16)(cid:18) (cid:4) ω3)
≈ θ0 − I sin θ0 (cid:16)(cid:18)

= θ0 − sin θ0 (cid:16)(cid:18)

where we have used the definition of ωn from Eq. (9.86). We see that the effect
of the kick is to make L quickly change its θ value (by only a small amount,
because we are assuming ω3 (cid:6) (cid:16)(cid:18)). The φ value doesn’t immediately change,
because immediately after the kick the x3 axis is still in exactly the same place,
because it hasn’t had time to move.

(b) After the kick is finished, L will trace out a cone around the z axis at approx-
imately the same rate as before, namely (cid:18)s. (None of the relevant quantities
in τ = dL/dt have changed much from the original circular-precession case,
so the precession frequency is basically the same.) So the new L has its (φ, θ )
coordinates given by

(9.197)

We’re assuming that (cid:18)s is very small, so if you want, you can ignore the (cid:18)s term
and just consider L to be fixed, at least on the time scale of the nutations (see
the remark below). But this term will cancel anyway in producing the following
equation. Looking at Eq. (9.91), we see that the coordinates of the CM relative
to L are

The sin θ0 factor in θ(t) is exactly what is needed for the CM to trace out a
circle around L, because a change in φ corresponds to a CM spatial change of
(cid:2)(cid:16)φ sin θ0, whereas a change in θ corresponds to a CM spatial change of (cid:2)(cid:16)θ.
Now let’s see how this relates to a free top. For ωn (cid:6) (cid:18)s, the time scale
on which L changes due to the gravitational torque (namely 1/(cid:18)s) is very long
compared with the time scale of the nutation (namely 1/ωn). Therefore, since
L is essentially motionless on the time scale of 1/ωn, the effects of gravity
are negligible on this time scale. Hence, the system should behave like a free
top. So let’s verify that the results here do indeed agree with the results from
Section 9.6.2.

Equation (9.55) in Section 9.6.2 says that the frequency of the precession of
ˆx3 around L for a free top is L/I . But the frequency of the precession of ˆx3
around L in the present problem is ωn, so this had better be equal to L/I . And
indeed, L is essentially equal to I3ω3, so ωn ≡ I3ω3/I = L/I . Therefore, for
short enough time scales (short enough so that L doesn’t move much), a nutating
top with ω3 (cid:6) (cid:16)(cid:18) (cid:6) (cid:18)s looks very much like a free top.

Remark: We need the (cid:16)(cid:18) (cid:6) (cid:18)s condition so that the nutation motion looks
roughly like circles (that is, like the top plot in Fig. 9.38, and not the others).
This requirement can be seen by the following reasoning. The time for one
period of the nutation motion is 2π/ωn. From Eq. (9.91), φ(t) increases by
(cid:16)φ = 2π(cid:18)s/ωn during this time. And also from Eq. (9.91), the diameter d
of the “circle” along the φ axis is roughly d = 2(cid:16)(cid:18)/ωn. The motion looks
approximately like a circle if d (cid:6) (cid:16)φ, that is, if (cid:16)(cid:18) (cid:6) (cid:18)s. ♣

9.27. Rolling without slipping

Yes, there are indeed other ways. It isn’t necessary for the contact points to form a
vertical great circle. They can form a smaller tilted circle, as shown in Fig. 9.101. In
this case the angular velocity vector points up to the left. There is indeed no slipping
here, and the ball rolls straight. You can convince yourself of this in the following way.
Imagine the ball hovering and spinning in place with its center at rest. At all times,
the point at the bottom of the ball is moving directly out of the page; the collection of
these points is the tilted circle in Fig. 9.101. Let the speed of the instantaneous bottom
point be v, and now imagine taking a horizontal sheet of paper and sliding it out of the
page with constant speed v, just beneath the ball, barely touching it. Since this is the

ω

452

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

ω

R

same speed as the bottom point on the ball (which is the contact point, because it’s at
the bottom), there is no slipping between the ball and the paper. Finally, if we go to
the reference frame of the paper, we have the desired motion of a ball rolling without
slipping on a flat surface.

If θ is the angle that ω makes with the horizontal, then the radius of the con-
tact circle is R cos θ . The linear speed of the ball is therefore ω(R cos θ ). If you
want, you can think of this as (ω cos θ )R. That is, only the horizontal component
of ω leads to translational motion of the ball. The vertical component simply yields
a spinning motion around the vertical diameter. If θ approaches 90◦, then the con-
tact circle is very small (see Fig. 9.102), so the speed of the ball is very small (for a
given ω).

In the real world, the contact area between the ball and the surface isn’t an idealized
single point, so if the contact circle isn’t a vertical great circle, there is inevitably some
slipping at the points near the bottom of the ball. The smaller the contact circle, the
more the slipping, because the slipping arises from the twisting motion around the
vertical diameter, which comes from the vertical component of ω. If you take an actual
ball and roll it with a tilted ω, you will find that the rolling motion is noisier the more
that ω is tilted. What you hear is the slipping due to the extended contact region. But
in an ideal world (or perhaps in a bowling alley, which is a reasonable approximation
thereof), a tilted ω wouldn’t be any noisier.

9.28. Rolling straight?

Intuitively, it is fairly clear that the sphere cannot change direction, but it is a little
tricky to prove. Qualitatively, we can reason as follows. Assume that there is a nonzero
friction force at the contact point. (The normal force is irrelevant here, because it
doesn’t provide a torque about the center, because the contact point is always directly
below the center. This is what is special about a sphere.) Then the sphere accelerates
in the direction of this force. However, you can show with the right-hand rule that this
force produces a torque that causes the angular momentum to change in a way that
corresponds to the sphere accelerating in the direction opposite to the friction force
(assuming that the sphere is rolling without slipping). There is thus a contradiction,
unless the friction force is equal to zero.

Let’s now be rigorous. Let the angular velocity of the sphere be ω, which may
point diagonally if the contact points don’t form a vertical great circle on the sphere.
The nonslipping condition says that the sphere’s CM velocity equals

The sphere’s angular momentum is

v = ω × (Rˆz).

L = I ω.

(9.199)

(9.200)

The friction force (if it exists) from the ground at the contact point changes both the
momentum and the angular momentum. F = dp/dt gives

And τ = dL/dt (relative to the center) gives

F = m

dv

.

(−Rˆz) × F = dL

,

(9.201)

(9.202)

because the force is applied at position −Rˆz relative to the center. We will now show
that the preceding four equations imply that ˙ω = 0. From Eq. (9.199), this then implies
that ˙v = 0, as desired.

Equations (9.199) and (9.201) give F = m ˙ω × (Rˆz). Plugging this F, along with the

L from Eq. (9.200), into Eq. (9.202) then gives

(−Rˆz) ×

m ˙ω × (Rˆz)

(cid:6)

= I ˙ω.

(9.203)

9.10 Solutions

453

The vector ˙ω must lie in the horizontal plane, because it equals the cross product
of two vectors, one of which is the vertical ˆz. This implies that (as you can verify)
ˆz × ( ˙ω × ˆz) = ˙ω. Therefore, Eq. (9.203) gives

−mR2 ˙ω = 2
5

mR2 ˙ω,

(9.204)

and so ˙ω = 0, as we wanted to show.

9.29. Ball on paper

Our strategy will be to produce, and then equate, two different expressions for the total
change in the angular momentum of the ball, relative to its center. The first comes
from the effects of the friction force on the ball. The second comes from looking at the
general form of the initial and final motion.

To produce our first expression for (cid:16)L, note that the normal force provides no
torque, so we can ignore it. The friction force, F, from the paper changes both p and
L according to

(cid:14)

(cid:16)p =

F dt,

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(9.205)

(cid:16)L =

τ dt =

(−Rˆz) × F dt = (−Rˆz) ×

F dt.

Both of these integrals run over the entire slipping time, which may include time on
the table after the ball leaves the paper. In the second line above, we have used the fact
that the friction force always acts at the same location, namely (−Rˆz), relative to the
center of the ball. The two above equations yield

(cid:16)L = (−Rˆz) × (cid:16)p.

(9.206)

To produce our second equation for (cid:16)L, let’s examine how L⊥ (the horizontal com-
ponent of L)32 is related to p when the ball is rolling without slipping, which is the
case at both the start and finish. When the ball is not slipping, we have the situation
show in Fig. 9.103 (assuming that the ball is rolling to the right). The magnitudes of p
and L⊥ are given by

p = mv,
L⊥ = I ω⊥ = 2

mR2ω⊥ = 2

Rm(Rω⊥) = 2

Rmv = 2

Rp,

(9.207)

where we have used the nonslipping condition, v = Rω⊥. (The actual I = (2/5)mR2
value for a solid sphere won’t be important for the final result.) We can now combine
the directions of L⊥ and p in Fig. 9.103 with the above L⊥ = (2/5)Rp scalar relation
to write

L⊥ = 2
5
where ˆz points out of the page. Since this relation is true at both the start and the finish,
it must also be true for the differences in L⊥ and p. That is,

Rˆz × p,

L

(cid:16)L⊥ = 2

Rˆz × (cid:16)p.

(9.209)

Fig. 9.103

32 The vertical component of L (which is nonzero only if ω has a vertical component, which is the
case if the contact points don’t form a vertical great circle on the ball) is constant, because the
torque from friction provides only a horizontal torque. We may therefore ignore it, because we
are concerned only with (cid:16)L.

454

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

But (cid:16)L⊥ = (cid:16)L because the vertical component of L doesn’t change, so Eqs. (9.206)
and (9.209) give

(−Rˆz) × (cid:16)p = 2
5

Rˆz × (cid:16)p =⇒ 0 = ˆz × (cid:16)p.

(9.210)

There are three ways this cross product can be zero:

• (cid:16)p is parallel to ˆz. But it isn’t, because (cid:16)p lies in the horizontal plane.
• ˆz = 0. Not true.
• (cid:16)p = 0. This is the only possibility, so it must be true. Therefore, (cid:16)v = 0, as we

wanted to show.

Note that the line of the final motion may very well be shifted sideways from the line
of the initial motion. But what we’ve shown is that the final line is parallel to the initial
line, and the speed is the same.

Remarks:

1. As stated in the problem, it’s fine if you move the paper in a jerky motion, so that
the ball slips around on it. We assumed nothing about the nature of the friction
force in the above reasoning. And we used the nonslipping condition only at the
initial and final times. The intermediate motion is arbitrary.

2. As a special case, if you start a ball at rest on a piece of paper, then no matter
how you choose to (horizontally) slide the paper out from underneath the ball,
the ball will be at rest in the end. The final position will most likely be different
from the initial position, but the ball will be at rest wherever it ends up.

3. You are encouraged to experimentally verify that these crazy claims are true.
Make sure that the paper doesn’t wrinkle, because a wrinkle would allow a force
to be applied at a point other than the contact point. And balls that don’t squish
are much better, of course, because the contact region better resembles a single
point. ♣

9.30. Ball on a turntable

Let the angular velocity of the turntable be (cid:18)ˆz, and let the angular velocity of the ball
(with respect to the lab frame) be ω, which may point diagonally if the contact points
don’t form a vertical great circle on the ball. If the ball is at position r (with respect to
the lab frame), then its CM velocity (with respect to the lab frame) may be broken up
into the velocity of the turntable (at position r) plus the ball’s velocity with respect to
the turntable. The nonslipping condition says that the latter is ω × (aˆz), where a is the
radius of the ball.33 The ball’s velocity with respect to the lab frame is thus

v = ((cid:18)ˆz) × r + ω × (aˆz).

(9.211)

The important point to realize in this problem is that the friction force from the turntable
is responsible for changing both the ball’s linear momentum and its angular momentum.
In particular, F = dp/dt gives

F = m

dv
dt

.

(9.212)

And the angular momentum of the ball is L = I ω, so τ = dL/dt (relative to the
center of the ball) gives

(−aˆz) × F = I

dω
dt

,

(9.213)

because the force is applied at position −aˆz relative to the center.

33 The velocity with respect to the turntable is actually ωt × (aˆz), where ωt is the angular velocity in
the turntable frame. But ωt differs from ω simply by the angular velocity of the turntable, which
is (cid:18)ˆz. This implies that ωt × (aˆz) = ω × (aˆz).

9.10 Solutions

We will now use the previous three equations to demonstrate that the ball undergoes

circular motion. Our goal will be to produce an equation of the form,

dv

= (cid:18)(cid:16) ˆz × v,

(9.214)

because this describes circular motion with frequency (cid:18)(cid:16) (to be determined).34 We
will eliminate F first, and then ω. Plugging the expression for F from Eq. (9.212) into

Therefore, in view of Eq. (9.214), we see that the ball undergoes circular motion, with
a frequency equal to 2/7 times the frequency of the turntable. Note that this result for
the frequency doesn’t depend on initial conditions. For an extension to this problem,
see Weltner (1987) and references therein.

Remarks:

1. Integrating Eq. (9.218) from the initial time to some later time gives

This equation describes circular motion, with the center located at the point,

rc = r0 + 7
2(cid:18)

(ˆz × v0),

(9.221)

34 Equation (9.214) describes circular motion because it implies that v has constant magnitude (since
the change in v is perpendicular to v), and so the direction of v changes at the constant angular rate
(cid:18)(cid:16)
. The only curve with these properties is a circle. If you want to be more mathematical, you can
integrate Eq. (9.214) to obtain v = (cid:18)(cid:16) ˆz × r + C, which can be written as dr/dt = (cid:18)(cid:16) ˆz × (r − rc),
which implies that d(r − rc)/dt = (cid:18)(cid:16) ˆz × (r − rc), which means that the length of r − rc doesn’t
change (because its change is perpendicular to itself). And since the changes are also constrained
to be perpendicular to ˆz, we must have a horizontal circle.

456

Angular momentum, Part II (General ˆL)

and with radius,

R = |r0 − rc| = 7
2(cid:18)
2. There are a few special cases to consider:

|ˆz × v0| = 7v0
2(cid:18) .

(9.222)

• If v0 = 0 (that is, if the spinning motion of the ball exactly cancels the
rotational motion of the turntable, so that the CM of the ball is at rest in the
lab frame), then R = 0 and the ball remains in the same place, as it should.
• If the ball is initially not spinning, and just moving along with the turntable,
then v0 = (cid:18)r0. The radius of the circle is therefore R = (7/2)r0, and its
center is located at, from Eq. (9.221),

rc = r0 + 7
2(cid:18)

(−(cid:18)r0) = − 5r0
2

.

(9.223)

The point on the circle diametrically opposite to the initial point is therefore
a distance rc +R = (5/2)r0 +(7/2)r0 = 6r0 from the center of the turntable.
• If we want the center of the circle to be the center of the turntable, then Eq.
(9.221) says that we need (7/2(cid:18))ˆz × v0 = −r0. This implies that v0 has
magnitude v0 = (2/7)(cid:18)r0 and points tangentially in the same direction as
the turntable moves. That is, the ball moves at 2/7 times the velocity of the
point on the turntable right beneath it.

3. The fact that the frequency (2/7)(cid:18) is a rational multiple of (cid:18) means that the
ball will eventually return to the same point on the turntable. In the lab frame,
the ball traces out two circles in the time it takes the turntable to undergo seven
revolutions. From the point of view of someone on the turntable, the ball “spirals”
around five times before returning to the original position.

4. If we look at a ball with moment of inertia I = βma2 (so a uniform sphere has
β = 2/5), then Eq. (9.217) shows that the “2/7” in Eq. (9.218) gets replaced
by “β/(1 + β).” If a ball has most of its mass concentrated at its center (so that
β → 0), then the frequency of the circular motion goes to 0, and the radius goes
to ∞ (as long as v0 (cid:13)= 0). ♣

Accelerating frames of reference

Newton’s laws hold only in inertial frames of reference. However, there are
many noninertial (that is, accelerating) frames that we might reasonably want to
consider, such as elevators, merry-go-rounds, and so on. Is there any possible
way to modify Newton’s laws so that they hold in noninertial frames, or do we
have to give up entirely on F = ma? It turns out that we can in fact hold on to our
good friend F = ma, provided that we introduce some new “fictitious” forces.
These are forces that a person in the accelerating frame thinks exist. If she applies
F = ma while including these new forces, then she will get the correct answer
for the acceleration a, as measured with respect to her frame.

To be quantitative about all this, we’ll have to spend some time figuring out
how the coordinates (and their derivatives) in an accelerating frame relate to those
in an inertial frame. But before diving into that, let’s look at a simple example
that demonstrates the basic idea of fictitious forces.

Imagine that you are standing on a train that is accelerating
Example (A train):
to the right with acceleration a. If you are to remain at the same spot on the train,
then there must be a friction force between the floor and your feet with magnitude
Ff = ma, pointing to the right. Someone standing in the inertial frame of the ground
simply interprets the situation as, “The friction force Ff , which equals ma, causes
your acceleration a.”

How do you interpret the situation in the frame of the train? Assume that there
are no windows, so that all you see is the inside of the train. As we will show below
in Eq. (10.11), you will feel a fictitious translation force, Ftrans = −ma, pointing
to the left. You therefore interpret the situation as, “In my frame (the frame of the
train), the friction force Ff = ma pointing to my right exactly cancels the mysterious
Ftrans = −ma force pointing to my left, resulting in zero acceleration (in my frame).”
Of course, if the floor of the train is frictionless so that there is no force at your
feet, then you will say that the net force on you is Ftrans = −ma, pointing to the
left. You will therefore accelerate with acceleration a to the left, with respect to your
frame (the train). In other words, you will remain motionless (or move with constant
velocity, if you happened to be moving initially) with respect to the inertial frame of
the ground, which is all quite obvious to someone standing on the ground.

In the case where the friction force at your feet is nonzero, but not large enough to
balance out the whole Ftrans = −ma force, you will end up being accelerated toward

the back of the train (in the frame of the train), with an acceleration that is less than
a. This undesired motion will continue until you make the required adjustments with
your feet or hands to balance out all of the Ftrans force.

Let’s now derive the fictitious forces in their full generality. The main task
here is to relate the coordinates in an accelerating frame to those in an inertial
frame, so this endeavor will require a bit of math.

10.1 Relating the coordinates
Consider an inertial coordinate system with axes ˆxI, ˆyI, and ˆzI, and let there be
another (possibly accelerating) coordinate system with axes ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz. These
latter axes are allowed to change in an arbitrary manner with respect to the inertial
frame. That is, the origin may undergo acceleration, and the axes may rotate (this
is the most general possible motion, as we saw in Section 9.1). These axes may
be considered to be functions of the inertial axes.

Let OI and O be the origins of the two coordinate systems. Let the vector from
OI to O be R, let the vector from OI to a given particle be rI, and let the vector
from O to the particle be r. See Fig. 10.1 for the 2-D case. Then

x

rI = R + r.

(10.1)

These vectors have an existence that is independent of any specific coordinate
system, but let’s write them in terms of some definite coordinates. We may write

x

I

R = X ˆxI + Y ˆyI + Z ˆzI,
rI = xI ˆxI + yI ˆyI + zI ˆzI,
r = x ˆx + y ˆy + zˆz.

(10.2)

For reasons that will become clear, we have chosen to write R and rI in terms of the
inertial-frame coordinates, and r in terms of the accelerating-frame coordinates.
If desired, Eq. (10.1) may be written as

xI ˆxI + yI ˆyI + zI ˆzI =

(cid:5)

X ˆxI + Y ˆyI + Z ˆzI

(cid:6)

(cid:5)

+

x ˆx + y ˆy + zˆz

(cid:6)

.

(10.3)

Our goal is to take the second time derivative of Eq. (10.1) and to then inter-
pret the result in an F = ma form. The second derivative of rI is the acceleration
of the particle with respect to the inertial system, so Newton’s second law tells us
that F = m¨rI. The second derivative of R is the acceleration of the origin of the
moving system. The second derivative of r is the tricky part. In view of its form
in Eq. (10.2), changes in r can come about in two ways. First, the coordinates
(x, y, z) of r, which are measured with respect to the moving axes, may change.
And second, the axes ˆx, ˆy, ˆz themselves may change. The point is that r is not

10.1 Relating the coordinates

459

just the ordered triplet (x, y, z). It is the whole expression, r = x ˆx + y ˆy + zˆz.
So even if (x, y, z) are fixed, meaning that r doesn’t change with respect to the
moving system, r can still change with respect to the inertial system if the ˆx, ˆy, ˆz
axes are moving. Let’s be quantitative about this.

Calculation of d 2r/dt 2
We should clarify our goal here. We would like to obtain d2r/dt2 in terms of
the coordinates in the accelerating frame, because we want to be able to work
entirely in terms of these coordinates so that a person in the accelerating frame
can write down an F = ma equation in terms of her coordinates only, without
having to consider the underlying inertial frame at all. In terms of the inertial
frame, d2r/dt2 is simply d2(rI −R)/dt2, but this isn’t very enlightening by itself.
The following exercise in taking derivatives works for a general vector A =
Ax ˆx + Ay ˆy + Az ˆz in the moving frame; it isn’t necessary that it be a position
vector. So we’ll work with a general A and then set A = r when we’re done. To
take d/dt of A = Ax ˆx + Ay ˆy + Az ˆz, we can use the product rule to obtain

Yes, the product rule works with vectors too. We’re doing nothing more than
expanding (Ax + dAx)(ˆx + d ˆx) − Ax ˆx, etc., to first order. Note that although we
have expressed the vector A in terms of the coordinate axes of the moving frame,
the total derivative dA/dt is measured with respect to the inertial frame. As
mentioned above, the total rate of change of A comes from two effects, namely
the two groups of terms in Eq. (10.4). The first group gives the rate of change
of A, as measured with respect to the moving frame. We’ll denote this quantity
by δA/δt.

The second group arises because the coordinate axes are moving. In what
manner are they moving? We have already extracted the motion of the origin of
the accelerating system by introducing the vector R, so the only thing left is a
rotation about some axis ω through this origin (see Theorem 9.1). The axis ω
may change with time, but at any instant a unique axis of rotation describes the
system. The fact that the axis may change will be relevant in finding the second
derivative of r, but not in finding the first derivative.

We saw in Theorem 9.2 that a vector B that has fixed length (the coordinate
axes here do indeed have fixed length) and that rotates with angular velocity
ω ≡ ω ˆω changes at a rate dB/dt = ω × B. In particular, d ˆx/dt = ω × ˆx, etc. So
in Eq. (10.4), the Ax(d ˆx/dt) term equals Ax(ω × ˆx) = ω × (Ax ˆx). Likewise for
the y and z terms. Combining them gives ω × (Ax ˆx + Ay ˆy + Az ˆz), which is just
ω × A. Therefore, Eq. (10.4) becomes

dA

=

+ ω × A.

(10.5)

460

Accelerating frames of reference

This agrees with the result obtained in Section 9.5, Eq. (9.41). We’ve basically
given the same proof here, but with a little more mathematical rigor.

We still have to take one more time derivative. Using the product rule, the

time derivative of Eq. (10.5) is

(10.7)

(10.8)

where r, v ≡ δr/δt, and a ≡ δ2r/δt2 are the position, velocity, and acceleration
of the particle, as measured with respect to the accelerating frame. In other words,
if the accelerating frame is enclosed in a windowless box, and if a person inside
the box paints a coordinate grid on the floor, then she can (assuming that she has
a clock at her disposal) measure r, v, and a without caring at all about what is
going on in the outside world.

You might be concerned that the r, v, and a on the right-hand side of
Eq. (10.8) are measured by someone in the rotating frame, whereas the d2r/dt2 on
the left-hand side is measured by someone in the inertial frame. But this apparent
discrepancy is a nonissue, because Eq. (10.8) is a statement about vectors, and
these vectors have an existence that is independent of the coordinate system that
is used to describe them. For example, the vector a points in a certain direction
(say, toward the distant star Sirius) and has a certain magnitude, independent of
whoever chooses to describe it with whatever coordinates.

10.2 The ﬁctitious forces

From Eq. (10.1) we have

d2r
dt2

= d2rI
dt2

− d2R
dt2 .

(10.9)

We can equate this expression for d2r/dt2 with the expression in Eq. (10.8),
and then multiply through by the mass m of the particle. Recognizing that

10.2 The ﬁctitious forces

461

m(d2rI/dt2) is the force F acting on the particle (F may be gravity, a normal
force, friction, tension, etc.), we can solve for ma to obtain

ma = F − m

d2R

− mω × (ω × r) − 2mω × v − m

where the fictitious forces are defined as

Ftrans ≡ −m

dt2 ,

Fcent ≡ −mω × (ω × r),
Fcor ≡ −2mω × v,

Faz ≡ −m

dω
dt

× r.

(10.11)

We have taken the liberty of calling these quantities “forces,” because the left-
hand side of Eq. (10.10) is ma, where a is measured by someone in the accelerating
frame. This person should therefore be able to interpret the right-hand side as
some effective force. In other words, if a person in the accelerating frame wishes
to calculate ma, she simply needs to take the true force F, and then add on all
the other terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (10.10), which she will then quite
reasonably interpret as forces (in her frame). She will consider Eq. (10.10) to be
an F = ma statement in the form,

ma =

(cid:19)

Facc,

(10.12)

where Facc represents all the forces, real or fictitious, in the accelerating frame.
All we’ve really done is transfer some terms to the other side of an equation and
reinterpret the result. The last three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (10.8) are
nothing more than various pieces of the acceleration. But if we transfer them to
the left-hand side and solve for a, we can then interpret them (after multiplying
by m) as forces in Eq. (10.10).

Of course, the extra terms in Eq. (10.10) are not actual forces. The constituents
of F are the only real forces in the problem (and they are the same in any frame).
All we are saying is that if our friend in the moving frame assumes that the extra
terms are real forces, and if she adds them to F, then she will get the correct
answer for ma, as measured in her frame.

For example, consider a box (far away from other objects, in outer space)
that accelerates at a rate of g = 10 m/s2 in some direction. A person in the box
feels a fictitious force of Ftrans = mg down into the floor. For all she knows,
she is in a box on the surface of the earth. If she performs various experiments
under this assumption, the results will always be what she expects. The surprising
fact that no local experiment can distinguish between the fictitious force in the

462

Accelerating frames of reference

accelerating box and the real gravitational force on the earth is what led Einstein
to his Equivalence Principle and his theory of General Relativity (discussed in
Chapter 14). These fictitious forces are more meaningful than you might think.

As Einstein explored elevators,
And studied the spinning ice-skaters,
He eyed as suspicious,
The forces, fictitious,
Of gravity’s great imitators.

Note that in addition to the sum of all the real forces, F, there are two different
types of quantities on the right-hand side of Eq. (10.10). The quantities r and v
are measured by someone inside the accelerating frame; they depend on what
the particle is doing. But d2R/dt2 and ω are properties of the frame. In general,
the person inside needs to be given their values, although it is possible for her to
figure out what they are in certain special cases (see Problem 10.9).

Let’s now look at each of the fictitious forces in detail. The translation and
centrifugal forces are fairly easy to understand. The Coriolis force is a little more
difficult. And the azimuthal force can be easy or difficult, depending on exactly
how ω is changing.

10.2.1 Translation force: −md 2R/dt 2

This is the most intuitive of the fictitious forces. We’ve already discussed this
force in the train example in the introduction to this chapter. If R is the position
of the train, then Ftrans ≡ −m d2R/dt2 is the fictitious translation force you feel
in the accelerating frame.

10.2.2 Centrifugal force: −mω × (ω × r)
This force goes hand-in-hand with the mv2/r = mrω2 centripetal acceleration
as viewed by someone in an inertial frame.

Fcent

Fig. 10.2

Example (Standing on a carousel): Consider a person standing motionless
with respect to a carousel, a distance r from the center. Let the carousel rotate in the
x-y plane with angular velocity ω = ωˆz (see Fig. 10.2). What is the centrifugal force
felt by the person?

Solution: ω × r has magnitude ωr and points in the tangential direction, in the
direction of motion. Therefore, mω × (ω×r) has magnitude mrω2 and points radially
inward. Hence, the centrifugal force −mω × (ω × r) has magnitude mrω2 and points
radially outward.

If the person is not moving with respect to the carousel, and if ω is constant,
Remark:
then the centrifugal force is the only nonzero fictitious force in Eq. (10.10). Since the

10.2 The ﬁctitious forces

463

person is not accelerating in her rotating frame, the net force (as measured in her frame)
must be zero. The forces in her frame are (1) gravity pulling downward, (2) the normal
force pushing upward (which cancels gravity), (3) the friction force pushing inward at her
feet, and (4) the centrifugal force pulling outward. We conclude that the last two of these
must cancel. So the friction force must point inward with magnitude mrω2.

Someone standing on the ground observes only the first three of these forces, so the
net force is not zero. And indeed, there is a centripetal acceleration, v2/r = rω2, due to
the friction force. To sum up: in the inertial frame, the friction force exists to provide a
centripetal acceleration. In the rotating frame, the friction force exists to balance out the
mysterious new centrifugal force, in order to yield zero acceleration. ♣

Example (Effective gravity force, mgeff): Consider a person standing motion-
less on the earth, at a polar angle θ ; the way we’ve defined it, θ equals π/2 minus
the latitude angle. In the rotating frame of the earth, the person feels a centrifugal
force (directed away from the axis) in addition to the gravitational force, mg; see
Fig. 10.3, although this figure is somewhat misleading, as explained in the first
remark below. Note that we’re using g to denote the acceleration due solely to
the gravitational force. This isn’t the “g-value” that the person measures, as we’ll
shortly see.

The sum of the gravitational and centrifugal forces (that is, what the person thinks
is gravity) doesn’t point radially, unless the person is at the equator or at a pole.
Let us denote the sum by mgeff . To calculate mgeff , we must calculate Fcent =
−mω × (ω × r). The ω × r part has magnitude Rω sin θ, where R is the radius of
the earth, and it is directed tangentially along the latitude circle of radius R sin θ. So
−mω × (ω × r) points outward from the axis, with magnitude mRω2 sin θ, which
is just what we expect for something traveling at frequency ω in a circle of radius
R sin θ. Therefore, the effective gravitational force,

(cid:5)

mgeff ≡ m

g − ω × (ω × r)

(cid:6)

,

(10.13)

−5 s

points slightly in the southerly direction (for someone in the northern hemisphere),
as shown in Fig. 10.4. The magnitude of the correction term, mRω2 sin θ, is small
−1 (that is, one revolution per day, which
compared with g. Using ω ≈ 7.3 · 10
is 2π radians per 86 400 seconds) and R ≈ 6.4 · 106 m, we find Rω2 ≈ 0.03 m/s2.
Therefore, the correction to g is about 0.3% at the equator (but zero at the poles).
However, this result does not imply that the value of geff is 0.3% smaller at the
equator than at the poles, because the value of g itself (which we’ve defined to
be the acceleration due to the gravitational force only) varies over the surface of
the earth, due to its slightly nonspherical shape. (It also varies on a local scale due to
density fluctuations and altitude.) When the centrifugal effect is combined with the
nonspherical effect, the result is that geff is about 0.5% smaller at the equator; see
Iona (1978).

Remarks:

1. We found above that the sum of the gravitational and centrifugal forces doesn’t point
radially. Interestingly, there are two reasons for this. The first, as we just saw, is
that under the (seemingly obvious) assumption that the earth’s gravitational force is
radial, the centrifugal force causes the sum not to be radial. The second reason is that

Fig. 10.5

the earth’s gravitational force actually isn’t radial; the bulge at the equator causes the
gravitational force to point slightly away from the center of the earth (except at the
equator or at a pole). This is believable, because the extra mass at the nearby part
of the bulge tends to shift the gravitational force in that direction. An exaggerated
picture of the situation is shown in Fig. 10.5. The result of the nonradial g is that
the effective gravitational force points even further from the radial direction than
expected. It turns out that the effect from the nonradial g on the direction of geff is
roughly equal to the effect from the centrifugal force.

So there is a feedback effect: The spinning of the earth causes geff to point away
from the radial, which causes the earth to bulge (because the surface of the earth
is, on average, perpendicular to geff ), which then causes geff to point a little further
from the radial, which causes the earth to bulge a little more, and so on. Problem
10.12 works out some of the details of this, but see Mohazzabi and James (2000) for
further discussion.

2. In the construction of buildings, and in similar matters, it is geff , and not g, that
determines the “upward” direction in which the building should point. The exact
directions of the earth’s gravitational force and center of the earth are irrelevant.
A plumb bob hanging from the top of a skyscraper touches exactly at the base. Both
the bob and the building point in a direction slightly different from both the radial
and g, but no one cares.

3. If you look in a table and find the value for the acceleration due to gravity in Boston,
remember that the number is the geff value and not the g value (which describes
only the gravitational force, in our terminology). The way we’ve defined it, the
g value is the acceleration with which things would fall if the earth kept its same
shape but somehow stopped spinning. The exact value of g is therefore generally
irrelevant. ♣

10.2.3 Coriolis force: −2mω × v

While the centrifugal force is a very intuitive concept (we’ve all gone around
a corner in a car), the same thing cannot be said about the Coriolis force. This
force requires a nonzero velocity v relative to the accelerating frame, and peo-
ple normally don’t move with an appreciable v with respect to their car while
rounding a corner. To get a feel for this force, let’s look at two special cases.

Fcor

ω

v

Fig. 10.6

Case 1 (Moving radially on a carousel): A carousel rotates counterclockwise
with constant angular speed ω. Consider someone walking radially inward on the
carousel (imagine a radial line painted on the carousel; the person walks along this
line), at speed v with respect to the carousel, at radius r. The angular velocity vector
ω points out of the page, where we’ve signified the “out” direction in Fig. 10.6 by a
little circle with a dot inside.

Remark: This remark might be a little picky, but I’ll say it anyway. The direction of
rotation is sometimes denoted by a curved arrow pointing tangentially along the circum-
ference of the carousel. But this is technically not correct, because it would imply that
the carousel is rotating in the rotating frame, which it isn’t; it’s just sitting there. And it’s
understood that Fig. 10.6 is in fact drawn in the rotating frame, and not the lab frame,
because it includes a fictitious force, which has nothing to do with the lab frame. (If you

10.2 The ﬁctitious forces

465

wanted to draw things in the lab frame, then you wouldn’t draw any fictitious forces, and
the velocity v would have a tangential component, at least in this setup.) ♣

The Coriolis force, −2mω × v, points tangentially in the direction of the motion of
the carousel, that is, to the person’s right in our scenario. It has magnitude

Fcor = 2mωv.

(10.14)

The person will have to counter this force with a tangential friction force of 2mωv
(pointing to his left) at his feet, so that he continues to walk on the same radial line.
Note that there is also the centrifugal force, which is countered by a radial friction
force at the person’s feet. But this effect won’t be important here.

Why does this Coriolis force exist? It exists so that the resultant friction force
changes the angular momentum of the person (measured with respect to the lab frame)
in the proper way, according to τ = dL/dt. To see this, take d/dt of L = mr2ω,
where ω is the person’s angular speed with respect to the lab frame, which is also the
carousel’s angular speed. Using dr/dt = −v, we have

dL
dt

= −2mrωv + mr2(dω/dt).

(10.15)

But dω/dt = 0, because the person remains on one radial line, and we are assuming
that the carousel is arranged to keep a constant ω. Equation (10.15) then gives dL/dt =
−2mrωv. So the L (with respect to the lab frame) of the person changes at a rate
−(2mωv)r. This is simply the radius times the tangential friction force applied by the
carousel. In other words, it is the torque applied to the person.

Remark: What if the person doesn’t apply a tangential friction force at his feet? Then the
Coriolis force of 2mωv produces a tangential acceleration of 2ωv in the rotating frame, and
hence also in the lab frame (initially, before the direction of the motion in the rotating frame
has a chance to change), because the frames are related by a constant ω. This acceleration
exists essentially to keep the person’s angular momentum (with respect to the lab frame)
constant. (It is constant in this scenario, because there are no tangential forces in the lab
frame.) To see that this tangential acceleration is consistent with conservation of angular
momentum, set dL/dt = 0 in Eq. (10.15) to obtain 2ωv = r(dω/dt) (this is the person’s
ω here, which is changing). The right-hand side of this is by definition the tangential
acceleration. Therefore, saying that L is conserved is the same as saying that 2ωv is the
tangential acceleration (for this situation where the inward radial speed is v). ♣

Case 2 (Moving tangentially on a carousel): Now consider someone walking
tangentially on a carousel in the direction of the carousel’s motion, with speed v
(relative to the carousel) at constant radius r (see Fig. 10.7). The Coriolis force
−2mω × v points radially outward with magnitude 2mωv. Assume that the person
applies the friction force necessary to continue moving at radius r.
There is a simple way to see why this outward force of 2mωv exists. Let V ≡ ωr
be the speed of a point on the carousel at radius r, as viewed by an outside observer.
If the person moves tangentially (in the same direction as the spinning) with speed v
relative to the carousel, then his speed as viewed by the outside observer is V + v.
The outside observer therefore sees the person walking in a circle of radius r at speed

Fig. 10.7

v

V + v. The acceleration of the person with respect to the ground frame is therefore
(V + v)2/r. This acceleration must be caused by an inward-pointing friction force at
the person’s feet, so

Ffriction = m(V + v)2

= mV 2

(10.16)

This friction force is the same in any frame. How, then, does our person on the carousel
interpret the three pieces of the inward-pointing friction force in Eq. (10.16)? The
first term balances the outward centrifugal force due to the rotation of the frame,
which he always feels. The third term is the inward force his feet must apply if he
is to walk in a circle of radius r at speed v, which is exactly what he is doing in the
rotating frame. The middle term is the additional inward friction force he must apply
to balance the outward Coriolis force of 2mωv (using V ≡ ωr). Said in an equivalent
way, the person on the carousel will write down an F = ma equation of the form
(taking radially inward to be positive),

(10.17)

We see that the net force he feels does indeed equal his ma, where a is measured with
respect to the rotating frame. Physically, the difference between the interpretations
of Eqs. (10.16) and (10.17) is the existence of fictitious forces in the rotating frame.
Mathematically, the difference is simply the rearrangement of terms.

For cases in between the two special cases above, things aren’t so clear, but
that’s the way it goes. Note that no matter what direction you move on a carousel,
the Coriolis force always points in the same perpendicular direction relative to
your motion. Whether it’s to your right or to your left depends on the direction
of the rotation. But given ω, you’re stuck with the same relative direction of the
force.

On a merry-go-round in the night,
Coriolis was shaken with fright.
Despite how he walked,
’Twas like he was stalked
By some fiend always pushing him right.

Let’s do some more examples . . .

Example (Dropped ball): A ball is dropped from height h, at a polar angle θ
(measured down from the north pole). How far to the east is the ball deflected, by the
time it hits the ground?

Solution: The angle between ω and v is π − θ, so the Coriolis force −2mω × v
is directed eastward with magnitude 2mωv sin θ, where v = gt is the speed at time

fore 2ωgt sin θ. Integrating this to obtain the eastward speed (with an initial eastward
speed of zero) gives veast = ωgt2 sin θ . Integrating again to obtain the eastward
deflection (with an initial eastward deflection of zero) gives deast = ωgt3 sin θ/3.

Remark: We can also solve this problem by working in an inertial frame; see Stirling
(1983). Figure 10.8 shows the setup where a ball is dropped from a tower of height h
located at the equator (the view is from the south pole). The earth is rotating in the inertial
frame, so the initial sideways speed of the ball, (R + h)ω, is larger than the sideways speed
of the base of the tower, Rω. This is the basic cause of the eastward deflection.

However, after the ball has moved to the right, the gravitational force on it picks up a
component pointing to the left, and this slows down the sideways speed. If the ball has
moved a distance x to the right, then the leftward component of gravity equals g sin φ ≈
g(x/R). Now, to leading order we have x = Rωt, so the sideways acceleration of the ball is
a = −g(Rωt/R) = −ωgt. Integrating this, and using the initial speed of (R + h)ω, gives
a rightward speed of (R + h)ω − ωgt2/2. Integrating again gives a rightward distance
of (R + h)ωt − ωgt3/6. Subtracting off the rightward position of the base of the tower
2h/g (neglecting higher-order effects such as the curvature
(namely Rωt), and using t ≈
of the earth and the variation of g with altitude), we obtain an eastward deflection of
2h/g, relative to the base of the tower. If the ball is
ωh
dropped at a polar angle θ instead of at the equator, then the only modification is that all
speeds are decreased by a factor of sin θ, so we obtain the result in Eq. (10.18). ♣

2h/g(1 − 1/3) = (2/3)ωh

Example (Foucault’s pendulum): This is the classic example of a consequence
of the Coriolis force. It unequivocally shows that the earth rotates. The basic idea
is that due to the rotation of the earth, the plane of a swinging pendulum rotates
slowly, with a calculable frequency. In the special case where the pendulum is at
one of the poles, this rotation is easy to understand. Consider the north pole. An
external observer, hovering above the north pole and watching the earth rotate, sees
the pendulum’s plane stay fixed (with respect to the distant stars) while the earth rotates
counterclockwise beneath it.2 Therefore, to an observer on the earth, the pendulum’s
plane rotates clockwise (viewed from above). The frequency of this rotation is of
course just the frequency of the earth’s rotation, so the earth-based observer sees the
pendulum’s plane make one revolution each day.

1 Technically, v = gt isn’t quite correct. Due to the Coriolis force, the ball will pick up a small
eastward velocity component (this is the point of the problem). This component will then produce
a second-order Coriolis force that affects the vertical speed (see Exercise 10.21). But we can ignore
this small effect in this problem. Also, we really mean geff instead of g, but any ambiguity in this
will have a negligible effect.

2 Assume that the pivot of the pendulum is a frictionless bearing, so that it can’t provide any torque

to twist the plane of the pendulum.

What if the pendulum is not at one of the poles? What is the frequency of the
precession? Let the pendulum be located at a polar angle θ. We will work in the
approximation where the velocity of the pendulum bob is horizontal (with respect to
the earth’s surface). This is essentially true if the pendulum’s string is very long; the
correction due to the rising and falling of the bob is negligible. The Coriolis force
−2mω × v points in some complicated direction, but fortunately we are concerned
only with the component that lies in the horizontal plane (that is, the plane of the
ground). The vertical component serves only to modify the apparent force of gravity
and is therefore negligible. Although the frequency of the pendulum does depend
on g, the resulting modification is very small. With this in mind, let’s break ω into
vertical and horizontal components in a coordinate system located at the pendulum.
From Fig. 10.9, we see that

ω = ω cos θ ˆz + ω sin θ ˆy.

(10.19)

We’ll ignore the y component, because it produces a Coriolis force in the z direction,
since v lies in the horizontal x-y plane. So for our purposes, ω is essentially equal to
ω cos θ ˆz. From this point on, the problem of finding the frequency of precession can
be done in numerous ways. We’ll present two solutions.

First solution (The slick way): The horizontal component of the Coriolis force
has magnitude

F horiz
cor

= |−2m(ω cos θ ˆz) × v| = 2m(ω cos θ)v,

(10.20)

and it is perpendicular to v(t). Therefore, as far as the pendulum is concerned, it
is located at the north pole of a planet called Terra Costhetica which has rotational
frequency of ω cos θ . 3 But as we saw above, the precessional frequency of a Foucault
pendulum located at the north pole of such a planet is simply

ωF = ω cos θ,

(10.21)

in the clockwise direction. So that’s our answer.

Second solution (In the pendulum’s frame): Let’s work in the frame of the
plane that the Foucault pendulum sweeps through. Our goal is to find the rate of
precession of this frame. With respect to a frame fixed on the earth (with axes ˆx,
ˆy, and ˆz as above), we know that this plane rotates with frequency ωF = −ωˆz if
we’re at the north pole (θ = 0), and with frequency ωF = 0 if we’re at the equator
(θ = π/2). So it’s a good bet that the general answer is ωF = −ω cos θ ˆz, and that’s
what we’ll now show.

Working in the frame of the plane of the pendulum is useful, because we can take
advantage of the fact that the pendulum feels no sideways forces in this frame, because
otherwise it would move out of the plane (which it doesn’t, by definition). The frame
fixed on the earth rotates with frequency ω = ω cos θ ˆz + ω sin θ ˆy, with respect to
the inertial frame. Let the pendulum’s plane rotate with frequency ωF = ωF ˆz with

3 As mentioned above, the setup isn’t exactly like the one on the new planet. There is also a vertical

component of the Coriolis force for the pendulum on the earth, but this effect is negligible.

10.2 The ﬁctitious forces

469

respect to the earth frame. Then the angular velocity of the pendulum’s frame with
respect to the inertial frame is

ω + ωF = (ω cos θ + ωF)ˆz + ω sin θ ˆy.

(10.22)

To find the horizontal component of the Coriolis force in this rotating frame, we care
only about the ˆz part of this frequency. The horizontal Coriolis force therefore has
magnitude 2m(ω cos θ + ωF)v. But in the frame of the pendulum, there must be zero
horizontal force, so this must be zero. Therefore,

ωF = −ω cos θ .

(10.23)

This agrees with Eq. (10.21), where we just wrote down the magnitude of ωF.

10.2.4 Azimuthal force: −m(d ω/dt ) × r
In this section, we will restrict ourselves to the simple and intuitive case where ω
changes only in magnitude, that is, not in direction (this more complicated case
is the subject of Problem 10.10). The azimuthal force may then be written as

Faz = −m ˙ω ˆω × r.

(10.24)

This force is easily understood by considering a person standing at rest with
respect to a rotating carousel. If the carousel speeds up, then the person must
feel a tangential friction force at his feet if he is to remain fixed on the carousel.
This friction force equals matan, where atan = r ˙ω is the tangential acceleration
as measured in the ground frame. But from the person’s point of view in the
rotating frame, he is not moving, so there must be some other mysterious force
that balances the friction. This is the azimuthal force. Quantitatively, when ˆω
is orthogonal to r, we have | ˆω × r| = r, so the azimuthal force in Eq. (10.24)
has magnitude mr ˙ω. This is the same as the magnitude of the friction force, as
it should be.

What we have here is exactly the same effect that we had with the translation
force on the accelerating train. If the floor speeds up beneath you, then you must
apply a friction force if you don’t want to be thrown backward with respect to the
floor. If you shut your eyes and ignore the centrifugal force, then you can’t tell if
you are on a linearly accelerating train, or on an angularly accelerating carousel.
The translation and azimuthal forces both arise from the acceleration of the floor.
(Well, for that matter, the centrifugal force does too.)

We can also view things in terms of rotational quantities, instead of the lin-
ear atan acceleration above. If the carousel speeds up, then a torque must be
applied to the person if he is to remain fixed on the carousel, because his angu-
lar momentum in the fixed frame increases. Therefore, he must feel a friction

470

Accelerating frames of reference

force at his feet. Let’s show that this friction force, which produces the change in
angular momentum of the person in the fixed frame, exactly cancels the azimuthal
force in the rotating frame, thereby yielding zero net force in the rotating frame.
Since L = mr2ω, we have dL/dt = mr2 ˙ω (assuming r is fixed). And since
dL/dt = τ = rF, we see that the required friction force is F = mr ˙ω. And as we
saw above, when ˆω is orthogonal to r, the azimuthal force in Eq. (10.24) also
equals mr ˙ω, in the direction opposite to the carousel’s motion. So the tangen-
tial forces in the rotating frame do indeed cancel. This was basically the same
calculation as the one above, but with an extra factor of r in the τ = dL/dt
equation.

Example (Spinning ice skater): We have all seen ice skaters increase their angu-
lar speed by bringing their arms in close to their body. This can be understood in terms
of angular momentum; a smaller moment of inertia requires a larger ω in order to keep
L constant. But let’s analyze the situation in terms of fictitious forces. We’ll idealize
things by giving the skater massive hands at the ends of massless arms attached to a
massless body.4 Let the hands have total mass m, and let them be drawn in radially.
Look at things in the skater’s frame (which has an increasing ω), defined by the
vertical plane containing the hands. The crucial thing to realize here is that the skater
always remains in the skater’s frame (a fine tautology, indeed). Therefore, the skater
must feel zero net tangential force in her frame, because otherwise she would accel-
erate with respect to it. Her hands are being drawn in by a muscular force that works
against the centrifugal force, but there can be no net tangential force on the hands in
the skater’s frame, by definition.

What are the tangential forces in the skater’s frame? Let the hands be drawn in at
speed v (see Fig. 10.10). Then there is a Coriolis force (in the same direction as the
spinning) with magnitude 2mωv. There is also an azimuthal force with magnitude
mr ˙ω (in the direction opposite to the spinning, as you can check). Since the net
tangential force is zero in the skater’s frame, we must have

2mωv = mr ˙ω.

(10.25)

ω

Fig. 10.10

Does this relation make sense? Well, let’s look at things in the ground frame. The
total angular momentum of the hands in the ground frame is constant. Therefore,
d(mr2ω)/dt = 0. Taking this derivative and using dr/dt ≡ −v gives Eq. (10.25).

A word of advice about using fictitious forces: Decide which frame you
are going to work in (the lab frame or the accelerating frame), and then stick
with it. The common mistake is to work a little in one frame and a little in the
other without realizing it. For example, you might introduce a centrifugal force
on someone sitting at rest on a carousel, but then also give her a centripetal

4 This reminds me of a joke about a spherical cow.

10.3 Tides

471

acceleration. This is incorrect. In the lab frame, there is a centripetal acceleration
(caused by the friction force) and no centrifugal force. In the rotating frame,
there is a centrifugal force (which cancels the friction force) and no centripetal
acceleration (because the person is sitting at rest on the carousel). In short, if you
ever mention the words “centrifugal” or “Coriolis,” etc., then you had better be
working in an accelerating frame.

10.3 Tides

The tides on the earth exist because the gravitational force from a point mass (or
a spherical mass, in particular the moon or the sun) is not uniform; the direction
of the force is not constant (the force lines converge to the source), and the
magnitude is not constant (it falls off like 1/r2). On the earth, these effects cause
the oceans to bulge around the earth, producing the observed tides. The study
of tides is useful in part because tides are a very real phenomenon in the world,
and in part because the following analysis gives us an excuse to use fictitious
forces and play around with Taylor series approximations. Before considering
the general case of tidal forces, let’s look at two special cases.

Longitudinal tidal force
In order to isolate the tidal effect, let’s consider a somewhat contrived setup
instead of the earth–sun or earth–moon system (we’ll eventually get to these).
Consider three masses in a line, as shown in Fig. 10.11. The right mass M is
very large and exerts a gravitational force on m1 and m2. But m1 and m2 are
sufficiently small so that they don’t exert much of a gravitational force on each
other. Furthermore, assume m2 (cid:6) m1. Let R be the distance from M to m2, and
let x be the distance from m1 to m2. Assume x (cid:4) R.

The masses m1 and m2 accelerate radially inward toward M . In the acceler-
ating reference frame of m2, what is the force on m1? To answer this, we must
add the fictitious translation force on m1 (which points to the left) to the actual
gravitational force on m1 (which points to the right). So in the accelerating frame
of m2, the net force on m1 is

Fnet = Fgrav + Ftrans = GMm1
(R − x)2
= GMm1
(R − x)2

ˆx − m1a2 ˆx

ˆx − GMm1

ˆx .

(10.26)

This is equivalent to the statement that m2 sees m1 accelerate away with

.

(10.28)

This is, of course, simply x times the derivative of the gravitational force. It
points to the right, so its effect is to increase the separation of the masses.

If you are riding along on m2, and if a black box encloses m1 and m2, then
as far as you are concerned, you may as well be in a black box floating freely
in outer space (from Einstein’s Equivalence Principle, discussed in Chapter 14).
But if you are floating in outer space, and if you see m1 accelerating away from
you with acceleration Fnet/m1 = 2GMx/R3, then you will naturally conclude
that in your reference frame, there must be a mysterious force of

“Ftidal” ≡ Fnet = 2GMm1x

R3

(10.29)

pulling m1 away from you. This force is called the tidal force because it is what
causes the tides, as we’ll see in detail below. Note that the tidal force is linear in
the separation x and inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the
source. If x is negative, so that m1 is on the left side of m2, then the tidal force is
negative, which means that m1 accelerates leftward away from you. So the effect
of the longitudinal tidal force is to increase the separation between the masses,
independent of the sign of x.

If you want to keep m1 at rest with respect to you, then you will have to tie
it down with a string, and the tension in the string will be 2GMm1x/R3. 5 Any
experiment you do inside the black box will indicate that there is a force pulling
m1 away from you. The only actual force on m1 is the gravitational force from M
equal to GMm1/(R − x)2, but because M gives m2 nearly the same acceleration
as m1, you perceive only the small Ftidal in Eq. (10.29). It is indeed small, because
it is the actual gravitational force times the quantity 2x/R (cid:4) 1.

Transverse tidal force
Consider now the setup shown in Fig. 10.12, with m2 at the corner of a right trian-
gle that has y (cid:4) R. The masses m1 and m2 accelerate radially inward toward M .
In the accelerating frame of m2, what is the force on m1? As above, we must
add the fictitious translation force on m1 (which points to the left) to the actual
gravitational force on m1 (which points to the right and slightly downward).

5 The tension in the string won’t affect the acceleration of m2, because m2 is assumed to be much larger
than m1. So our accelerating frame is still defined to be the one that accelerates with acceleration
a2 = GM/R2. This is where the m2 (cid:6) m1 assumption comes in.

10.3 Tides

473

In this case, however, the magnitudes of the gravitational accelerations of m1
and m2 are essentially equal, because they are both a distance R from mass M ,
up to second-order effects in y/R (by the Pythagorean theorem). The direction is
the only thing that is different, to first order in y/R. So in the accelerating frame
of m2, the net force (which we’ll call the tidal force from now on) on m1 is

Ftidal = Fgrav + Ftrans ≈ GMm1

(10.30)

where we have used cos θ ≈ 1 and sin θ ≈ y/R. This difference is simply the
y component of the force on m1, which is what you would expect. It points
along the line joining the masses, and its effect is to pull them together. As in
the longitudinal case, the transverse tidal force is linear in the separation and
inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the source.

General tidal force
We will now calculate the tidal force on a mass m located at an arbitrary point
on a circle of radius r (for example, this circle could represent a cross section of
the earth), due to a mass M located at the vector −R (so the vector from M to m
is R + r); see Fig. 10.13. We will calculate the tidal force relative to the center
of the circle. That is, we will find the net force on m in the accelerating frame
whose origin is the center of the circle. As usual, assume r (cid:4) R. And for now
let’s ignore any orbital motion of the circle around M (although it turns out that
this isn’t relevant to tides anyway; see the third remark below), so the circle just
accelerates radially inward toward M .

The gravitational force on m may be written as Fgrav = −GMm(R + r)/
|R + r|3. The cube is in the denominator because the vector in the numerator
contains one power of the distance. As above, adding on the fictitious translation
force due to the acceleration of the center of the circle (which is independent of
whatever mass we put there) yields a tidal force of

(10.31)

This is the exact expression for the tidal force. However, it is rather useless.6
Let us therefore make some approximations in Eq. (10.31) and transform it into
something technically incorrect (as approximations tend to be), but far more
useful. The first thing we need to do is rewrite the |R + r| term. We have

(10.32)

(10.33)

(10.34)

This is the general expression for the tidal force. We can put it in a simpler form
if we let M lie on the positive x axis, which we can arrange for with a rotation
of the axes. We then have ˆR = −ˆx, and so ˆR · r = −x. Equation (10.34) then
tells us that the tidal force on a mass m at position r ≡ (x, y), due to a mass M at
position (R, 0), equals

Ftidal(x, y) ≈ GMm
R3

(3x ˆx − (x ˆx + y ˆy)) = GMm
R3

(2x, −y).

(10.35)

This reduces properly in the longitudinal and transverse cases considered above.
The tidal forces at various points on the circle are shown in Fig. 10.14. Since our
setup with M on the x axis is invariant under rotations around the x axis, this
picture of forces is also invariant. And because of the left–right symmetry, the
picture would look the same if M were placed on the negative x axis.

The potential energy associated with the tidal force in Eq. (10.35) is propor-
tional to −x2 + y2/2, because the negative gradient of this yields the (2x, −y)
vector. Using x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ, the potential can be written as

Vtidal(r, θ) ≈ GMmr2
2R3

(−2 cos2θ + sin2θ) = GMmr2
2R3

(1 − 3 cos2θ).

(10.36)

If the earth were a rigid body, then the tidal force would have no effect on it.
But the water in the oceans is free to slosh around, so it bulges along the line
from the earth to the moon, and also along the line from the earth to the sun.

Fig. 10.14

10.3 Tides

475

And it also gets drawn in and forms a dip along the directions transverse to the
moon and sun.7 We’ll see below that the moon’s effect is about twice the sun’s.
As the earth rotates beneath the bulge and dip, a person on the earth sees them
rotate in the other direction relative to the earth. From Fig. 10.14, we see that
this produces two high tides and two low tides per day.8 It’s actually not exactly
two per day, because the moon moves around the earth. But this motion is fairly
slow, taking about a month, so it’s a reasonable approximation to think of the
moon as motionless.

Note that it is not the case that the moon pushes the water away on the far side
of the earth. It pulls on that water, too; it just does so in a weaker manner than it
pulls on the rigid part of the earth. With tides, it’s not the force that matters, but
rather the difference in force. Tides are a comparative effect. A child playing with
a shovel and a pail on a beach will be able to do so only until the earth rotates
to a point where the beach enters the region where the moon pulls on the water
sufficiently more (or less) than it pulls on the rigid earth.

Whether sieged by an army more grand,
Or swamped by the tides in the sand,
It’s a matter of course
That the difference in force
Is what leads to a castle’s last stand.

Remarks:

1. Consider a mass on the surface of the earth. It turns out that the gravitational force from
the sun on it is (much) larger than that from the moon, whereas the tidal force from the
sun on it is (slightly) weaker than that from the moon. Quantitatively, the ratio of the
gravitational forces is

7 There’s actually a lag effect as the earth rotates, due to various complicated things, so the bulge

doesn’t point directly toward the moon or sun. But let’s not worry about that here.

8 We’ve made the incorrect but fairly reasonable approximation that the moon lies in the plane of the
earth’s equator. If you solve the problem exactly by taking into account the position of the moon
relative to the equator, you will find that there is a piece of the tides (known as the diurnal tide)
that has a period of one day, in addition to the piece we just found (the semidiurnal tide) with a
period of half a day. See Horsfield (1976). If you want to derive this result yourself, a hint is that
you’ll need to use Eqs. (10.36) and (B.7).

476

Accelerating frames of reference

Depending on the relative positions of the sun and moon with respect to the earth, their
tidal effects may add (when the three bodies are collinear; this is called a “spring” tide),
or they may partially cancel (when the sun and moon make a 90◦ angle in the sky; this is
called a “neap” tide).

2. Equation (10.38) shows that the moon’s tidal effect is roughly twice the sun’s. This has
the following interesting implication about the densities of the moon and sun. The tidal
force from, say, the moon is proportional to

where θM is half of the angular size of the moon in the sky. Likewise for the sun’s tidal
force. But it just so happens that the angular sizes of the sun and the moon are essentially
equal, as you can see by looking at them (preferably quickly in the case of the sun, and
through some thick haze), or by noting that total solar eclipses barely exist. Therefore, the
combination of Eq. (10.38) and Eq. (10.39) tells us that the moon’s density is about twice
the sun’s. It is quite remarkable that, at least roughly, you can experimentally determine
the ratio of the densities of two celestial bodies by spending a few weeks at the beach.
3. There is one effect that we’ve glossed over, but fortunately it turns out not to be relevant.
In the above analysis, we derived the tidal force by subtracting the fictitious translation
force from the gravitational force. But in the actual case of the earth, the fictitious force
is generally interpreted as a centrifugal force, because the earth is rotating around the
earth–moon CM, and this CM is also rotating around the sun. And, of course, the earth is
rotating around its axis. Basically, there’s a lot of rotation going on.

Now, because the centrifugal force (from the sum of all the rotations) depends on
position, there is a difference between the centrifugal force at the center of the earth and
at a point on the surface. Shouldn’t this difference come into play when calculating the
net force in the accelerating frame whose origin is the center of the earth? Well, yes …
and no …

There are many ways of breaking up the earth’s motion, but for the present purposes the
most useful way is the following. The motion of any object can be described as the sum
of the translation of a nonrotating frame (for example, the seat on a ferris wheel), plus a
rotation around a point in that frame (the seat on an old-fashioned ferris wheel wouldn’t
have any such rotation, but the seat on a more modern scary kind of amusement park ride
undoubtedly would).

The first of these two motions accounts for the motion of the earth as a whole around
the earth–moon CM and also for the motion of this CM around the sun.9 The only relevant
fictitious force here is the translation force (at any instant in this motion, every atom in the
earth has the same acceleration vector, so there is no need to think in terms of rotation),
and this translation force is what we used in the above derivation of the tidal force.10 The
second of the two motions accounts for the rotation of the earth on its axis. This most
certainly does create a centrifugal force difference between the center of the earth and a
point on the surface, but this difference doesn’t contribute to the tides; it contributes only
to the uniform bulge of the earth at the equator. Since the force is uniform, it doesn’t cause
water to slosh around, so it therefore doesn’t have anything to do with the tides.

9 Just imagine grabbing the earth with a very large hand and sliding it around without twisting your

hand, so that a given point on the earth always has the same view of stars in the sky.

10 If you insist on thinking in terms of circular motion as you slide the earth in a circle around the sun
without twisting your hand, you can indeed view every point in the earth as moving in a circle. But
all of these circles have the same radius; they simply have offset centers. The centrifugal forces
are therefore all the same (in both magnitude and direction), and so there are no differences to
worry about.

10.4 Problems

477

So the answers to the above question are: Yes, because the difference really does
contribute to the net force. But no, because it doesn’t contribute to the tides, which is
what we’re concerned with here.

If you work out the actual numbers, you’ll see that the centrifugal force completely
dominates the tidal force. This is consistent with the fact that the equatorial bulge is on the
order of kilometers, whereas the tides are on the order of meters. But the point is that the
centrifugal force doesn’t affect the tides because it is uniform around the earth. The tidal
force, on the other hand, has the nonuniform shape in Fig. 10.14. The football-shaped
bulge it creates therefore moves around relative to the earth as the earth rotates beneath it.
To sum up: with the tidal force (which we define as the force that produces the tides), we
are not concerned with the total difference in force between a point on the earth and the
center, but rather only with the part of the difference that isn’t invariant under rotations
of the earth. ♣

A mass is at rest with respect to the lab frame, while a frictionless
turntable rotates beneath it. The frequency of the turntable is ω, and
the mass is located at radius r. In the frame of the turntable, find the
forces acting on the mass, and verify that F = ma.

10.6. Released mass *

A mass is bolted down to a frictionless turntable. The frequency of
rotation is ω, and the mass is located at radius a. The mass is then
released. Viewed from an inertial frame, it travels in a straight line.
In the rotating frame, what path does the mass take? Specify r(t) and
θ(t), where θ is the angle with respect to the initial radius, as mea-
sured in the rotating frame. Solve this by working in the inertial frame.
(Exercise 10.25 deals with the more difficult task of working in the
rotating frame.)

10.7. Coriolis circles *

A puck slides with speed v on frictionless ice. The surface is “level”
in the sense that it is orthogonal to geff at all points. Show that the
puck moves in a circle, as seen in the earth’s rotating frame. What is
the radius of the circle? What is the frequency of the motion? Assume
that the radius of the circle is small compared with the radius of the
earth.

10.9. Determining your frame **

Imagine that you are on a large rotating disk, with ω perpendicular to
the disk at its center. Assume that you know that the center of the disk is
fixed, and that no real forces act on anything on the disk (except gravity
pulling down, which is canceled by the normal force). Assume that ω
changes only in magnitude, and that this rate of change is constant. Is it
possible for you to determine ω and dω/dt, and also the location of
the center of the disk, by performing experiments in the rotating frame
only?

10.10. Changing ω’s direction ***

Consider the special case where a reference frame’s ω changes only
in direction (that is, not in magnitude). In particular, consider a cone

10.4 Problems

rolling on a table, which is a natural example of such a situation. Let the
origin of the cone frame be the tip of the cone. This point remains fixed
in the inertial frame. The instantaneous ω for a rolling cone points
along its line of contact with the table, because these are the points that
are instantaneously at rest. This line precesses around the origin. Let
the frequency of the precession be (cid:18).

In order to isolate the azimuthal force, paint a dot on the surface of
the cone (call it point P), and consider the moment when the dot lies
on the instantaneous ω (see Fig. 10.17). From Eq. (10.11), we see that
there are no contributions from the centrifugal force (because P lies
on ω), the Coriolis force (because P is not moving in the cone frame),
or the translation force (because the tip of the cone is fixed). The only
remaining fictitious force is the azimuthal force, and it exists due to
the fact that ω is changing. Equivalently, it arises from the fact that P
is accelerating up away from the table.

(a) Find the acceleration of P.
(b) Use Eq. (10.11) to calculate the azimuthal force on a mass m
located at P, and show that the result is consistent with the
acceleration you found in part (a).

10.11. Unwinding string ****

A wheel with radius R is placed flat on a table. A massless string with
one end attached to the rim of the wheel is wrapped clockwise around
the wheel a large number of times. When the string is wrapped com-
pletely around the wheel, a point mass m is attached to the free end
and glued to the wheel. The wheel is then made to rotate with con-
stant angular speed ω. At some point, the glue on the mass breaks,
and the mass and string gradually unwind (with the speed of the wheel
kept constant at ω by a motor, if necessary). Show that the length
of the unwound string increases at the constant rate Rω, for both the
clockwise and counterclockwise directions for ω. (The latter is the
tricky one.)

10.12. Shape of the earth ****

The earth bulges slightly at the equator, due to the centrifugal force in
the earth’s rotating frame. The goal of this exercise is to find the shape
of the earth, first incorrectly, and then correctly.

(a) The common incorrect method is to assume that the gravita-
tion force from the slightly nonspherical earth points toward the
center, and to then calculate the equipotential surface (incor-
porating both the gravitational and centrifugal forces). Show
that this method leads to a surface whose height (relative to a

480

spherical earth of the same volume) is given by

h(θ) = R

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

Rω2
6g

(3 sin2θ − 2),

(10.40)

where θ is the polar angle (the angle down from the north pole),
and R is the radius of the earth.

(b) The above method is incorrect, because the slight distortion of
the earth causes the gravitational force to not point toward the
center of the earth (except at the equator and the poles). This tilt
in the force direction then changes the slope of the equipotential
surface, and it turns out (although this is by no means obvious)
that this effect is of the same order as the slope of the surface
found in part (a). Your task: Assuming that the density of the
earth is constant,11 and that the correct height takes the form
times the result found in part (a),12
of some constant factor f
show that f = 5/2.13 Do this by demanding that the potential at
a pole equals the potential at the equator. Feel free to do things
numerically.

10.13. Southward deflection ****

A ball is dropped from height h (small compared with the radius
of the earth) at a polar angle θ. Assume (incorrectly) that the earth
is a perfect sphere. Show that a second-order Coriolis effect leads
to a southward deflection (in the northern hemisphere) equal to
(2/3)(ω2h2/g) sin θ cos θ.14

It turns out that the actual southward deflection is larger than this;
it equals 4(ω2h2/g) sin θ cos θ. So apparently there are other effects
at work. The main task of this problem is to show how the factor of
2/3 turns into a factor of 4. In what follows, we will keep terms up to
order ω2 (or technically ω2R/g) and order h/R. Also, it will be easiest
to calculate southward distances relative to the point on the ground

11 This isn’t true, but it’s a very difficult problem to solve with a nonconstant density, assuming that

we even know what the density is as a function of radius.

12 Satellite data show that the general shape found in Eq. (10.40) is essentially correct, up to some
factor. This is known as the quadrupole shape; the (3 sin2θ − 2) term is often written as (1 −
3 cos2θ). I can’t think of a clean theoretical way to justify the assumption that the shape is of this
form, so let’s just accept it. It still makes for a very nice problem.

13 If (cid:16)h is the difference between the equatorial and polar radii, then this factor of 5/2 takes the
incorrect (cid:16)h of about 11 km (as you can show) in Eq. (10.40) and turns it into about 28 km, which
is reasonably close to the observed value of 21.5 km. The discrepancy arises from the fact that the
density of the earth isn’t constant; it decreases with the radius.

14 By this we mean that the Coriolis effect causes the ball to land this far south of the point where a
plumb bob (hanging from where the ball is dropped) touches the ground. Measuring the deflection
relative to the point on the ground along the radius to the dropping point would be impractical,
because there is no way of knowing where the center of the earth is.

10.4 Problems

481

along the radius to the dropping point; call this point P. But our final
goal will be to determine the southward distance relative to a hanging
plumb bob.

(a) Show that

the distance between the plumb bob and P is

(ω2Rh/g) sin θ cos θ(1 − h/R).

(b) The fact that the gravitational force decreases with height implies
2h/g to hit the

that the ball takes more time than the standard
ground. Show that the time equals

2h/g(1 + 5h/6R).

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

(c) Let y be the height above the ground, and let z be the southward
distance away from the radial line to the dropping point. Show
that the centrifugal force yields a southward acceleration away
from the radial line equal to ¨z = ω2(R + y) sin θ cos θ.

(d) Show that the gravitational force yields a northward acceleration

back toward the radial line equal to ¨z = −g(z/R).

(e) Combine parts (b), (c), and (d) to show that the centrifugal and
gravitational forces lead to a southward deflection away from P
equal to (ω2Rh/g) sin θ cos θ(1 + 7h/3R). Adding on the above
Coriolis effect and subtracting off the position of the plumb bob
then quickly yields the desired factor of 4. (This problem is based
on Belorizky and Sivardiere (1987).)

Section 10.3: Tides

10.14. Bead on a hoop **

A bead of mass m is constrained to move on a frictionless hoop of radius
r that is located a distance R from an object of mass M . Assume that
R (cid:6) r, and assume that M is much larger than the mass of the hoop,
which is much larger than m.

(a) If the hoop is held fixed and the bead is released from a point
close to the rightmost point, as shown in Fig. 10.18, what is the
frequency of small oscillations?

(b) If the hoop is released and the bead starts at a point close to
the rightmost point, what is the frequency of small oscillations?
Assume that you grab M and move it to the right to keep it a
distance R from the hoop. (The time scale of oscillations turns out
to be on the same order as the time scale of the hoop reaching M ,
if M stays fixed.)

10.15. Precession of the equinoxes ***

Because the earth bulges at the equator, and because its axis of rotation
is tilted with respect to the plane of the ecliptic (the plane containing
the sun and (nearly) the moon), the tidal forces from the sun and the
moon produce a torque on the earth, which causes the axis of rotation

to precess. The rate of precession is slow; the period is about 26 000
years. Derive (approximately) this result in the following way.15

We’ll be making some rough approximations here, but our goal is
simply to understand intuitively what’s going on, and to get an answer
that’s in the right ballpark. Assume that: (1) the axis of the earth is tilted
at 23◦ with respect to the plane of the ecliptic; (2) the equatorial bulge
can be approximated by two point masses located on the equator, at the
highest and lowest points relative to the plane of the ecliptic; (3) the
mass of each of these effective point masses comes from a patch on
the earth with an area of, say, r2, where r is the radius of the earth
(this is just a guess); (4) the patch has an essentially constant height of
h ≈ 21 km, which is the difference between the equatorial and polar
radii; (5) the mass density of the patch is roughly the average density
of the earth (which isn’t true); (6) the earth spends half of its time in
the summer/winter orientation, and half in the spring/fall orientation;
(7) the moon’s tidal effect is twice the sun’s. Numerical values of
various constants can be found in Appendix J.

10.5 Exercises

Section 10.2: The fictitious forces

10.16. Swirling down a drain *

Does the Coriolis force cause the rotation you often see in water going
down a drain? That is, does the water rotate in different directions in
the northern and southern hemispheres? A rough order-of-magnitude
argument is sufficient. See Shapiro (1962) for a discussion of this.

10.17. Magnitude of geff *

Consider (unrealistically) a perfectly spherical rotating planet whose g
value is constant over the surface. What is the magnitude of geff as a
function of θ? Give your answer to the leading-order correction in ω.

10.18. Oscillations across the equator *

Consider (unrealistically) a perfectly spherical rotating planet whose g
value is constant over the surface. A bead lies on a frictionless wire that
lies in the north–south direction across the equator. The wire takes the
form of an arc of a circle; all points are the same distance from the center
of the earth. The bead is released from rest, a short distance from the

15 It’s possible to derive this by taking into account the exact shape of the earth, but this is very
complicated. It’s also possible to derive it to a good approximation by treating the earth’s equatorial
bulge as a thin ring of mass at the equator, but this is likewise fairly involved; see Haisch (1981).
So we’ll use a simplified point-mass model, which will still give a reasonable answer.

equator. Because geff does not point directly toward the earth’s center,
the bead will head toward the equator and undergo oscillatory motion.
What is the frequency of these oscillations?

10.19. Circular pendulum *

Consider a circular pendulum of mass m and length (cid:2), as shown in
Fig. 10.19. The mass swings around in a horizontal circle with the
(massless) string always making an angle θ with the vertical. Find the
angular speed, ω, of the mass. Solve this in:

(a) The lab frame. Draw the free-body diagram for the mass, and
write down the F = ma equations in the vertical and horizontal
directions.

for the mass, and write down the F = ma equations in the vertical
and horizontal directions.

symmetry axis. If the water is at rest with respect to the bucket, find
the shape of the water’s surface.

10.21. Corrections to gravity **

A mass is dropped from a point directly above the equator. Consider
the moment when the object has fallen a distance d. If we consider only
the centrifugal force, then you can quickly show that the correction to
geff at this point (relative to the release point) is an increase by ω2d.
There is, however, also a second-order Coriolis effect. What is the sum
of these corrections?16

10.22. Bug on a hoop **

A hoop of radius R is made to rotate at constant angular speed ω around
a diameter, as shown in Fig. 10.20. A small bug of mass m walks at
constant angular speed (cid:18) around the hoop. Let F be the total force that
the hoop applies to the bug when the bug is at the angle θ shown, and
let F⊥ be the component of F that is perpendicular to the plane of the
hoop. Find F⊥ in two ways (ignore gravity in this problem):

(a) Work in the lab frame: At the angle θ, find the rate of change of
the bug’s angular momentum around the rotation axis, and then
consider the torque on the bug.

(b) Work in the rotating frame of the hoop: At the angle θ, find the

relevant fictitious force, and then take it from there.

16 The value of g also varies with height, and this produces an increase in geff equal to g(2d/R).

You can show that this is much larger than the above centrifugal and Coriolis effects.

A frictionless hoop of radius R is made to rotate at constant angular
speed ω around a diameter. A bead on the hoop starts on this diame-
ter and is then given a tiny kick. Let N be the total force that the hoop
applies to the bead, and let N⊥ be the component of N that is perpendic-
ular to the plane of the hoop. Where is N⊥ maximum? What is the mag-
nitude of N as a function of position? (Ignore gravity in this problem.)

10.24. Projectile with Coriolis **

At a polar angle θ, a projectile is fired eastward at an inclination angle α
above the ground. Find the westward and southward deflections due to
the Coriolis force. In terms of θ, what angle αmax yields the maximum
total distance of deflection? What is αmax when θ equals 60◦, 45◦, and
(approximately) 0◦? What about values of θ larger than 60◦?

10.25. Free-particle motion **

A particle slides on a frictionless turntable that rotates counterclock-
wise with constant frequency ω. When viewed in an inertial frame, the
particle simply travels in a straight line. But in the rotating frame of
the turntable, show that the F = ma equations take the form,

¨x = ω2x + 2ω˙y,

¨y = ω2y − 2ω˙x,

(10.41)

and verify that the solutions to these differential equations are17

x(t) = (A + Bt) cos ωt + (C + Dt) sin ωt,
y(t) = −(A + Bt) sin ωt + (C + Dt) cos ωt.

10.26. Coin on a turntable ***

A coin stands upright at an arbitrary point on a rotating turntable, and
spins (without slipping) at the required angular speed to make its cen-
ter remain motionless in the lab frame. In the frame of the turntable,
the coin rolls around in a circle with the same frequency as that of the
turntable. In the frame of the turntable, show that

(a) F = dp/dt, and
(b) τ = dL/dt (Hint: Coriolis).
10.27. Precession viewed from rotating frame ***

Consider a top made of a wheel with all its mass on the rim. A massless
rod (perpendicular to the plane of the wheel) connects the CM to a pivot.

17 If you want, you can derive these solutions in the spirit of Chapter 4 by guessing exponential
solutions to the F = ma equations. You will find that there are degenerate solutions, which lead
to the (A + Bt) type terms that we saw in the critically damped case in Section 4.3.

10.5 Exercises

485

Initial conditions have been set up so that the top undergoes precession,
with the rod always horizontal. In the language of Fig. 9.30, we may
write the angular velocity of the top as ω = (cid:18)ˆz + ω(cid:16) ˆx3 (where ˆx3 is
horizontal here).

Consider things in the frame rotating around the ˆz axis with angular
speed (cid:18). In this frame, the top spins with angular speed ω(cid:16) around its
fixed symmetry axis. Therefore, in this frame we must have τ = 0,
because L is constant. Verify explicitly that τ = 0 (calculated with
respect to the pivot) in this rotating frame (you will need to find the
relation between ω(cid:16) and (cid:18)). In other words, show that the torque
due to gravity is exactly canceled by the torque due to the Coriolis
force (you can quickly show that the centrifugal force provides no net
torque).

At what angle from the horizontal is the tangential component of the

A bead of mass m is constrained to move on a frictionless hoop of
radius r that is located a distance R from an object of mass M . Assume
R (cid:6) r, and assume that M is much larger than the mass of the hoop,
which is much larger than m.

(a) If the hoop is held fixed and the bead is released from the top
point, as shown in Fig. 10.21, what is its speed when it gets to
the rightmost point on the hoop?

(b) If the hoop is released and the bead starts at a point just slightly
to the right of the top point, what is its speed with respect to the
hoop when it gets to the rightmost point on the hoop? Assume
that you grab M and move it to the right to keep it a distance R
from the hoop.

10.30. Facing the planet **

A bead of mass m is constrained to move on a frictionless hoop of radius
r that orbits a planet of mass M , a distance R from it. Initial conditions
have been set up so that the plane of the hoop is always perpendicular
to the line from it to the planet. Assume R (cid:6) r, and assume that the
mass of the hoop is much larger than m. Draw the force lines in the
reference frame of the hoop (in the spirit of Fig. 10.14). If the bead is
released from a point close to the front point on the hoop, what is the
frequency of small oscillations?

than the gravitational force attracting the sand to the rock. The cutoff

10.6 Solutions

10.1. Which way down?

There are actually (at least) four possible definitions for the point “below” you on the
ground: (1) the point that lies along the line between you and the center of the earth,
(2) the point that lies along the direction of the earth’s gravitational force, (3) the
point where a hanging plumb bob rests (that is, the point that lies along the direction
of the effective gravitational force), and (4) the point where a dropped object hits the
ground.

The third definition is the most reasonable, because it defines the upward direction
in which buildings are constructed. At any rate, the third and fourth definitions are the
only ones you can make any practical use of. The third differs from the second due
to the centrifugal force, which makes geff point in a slightly southward direction (in
the northern hemisphere) relative to the gravitational force g. It additionally differs
from the first due to the fact that g isn’t radial (see the first remark at the end of
Section 10.2.2). And it differs from the fourth due to the Coriolis force, which causes
a falling object to be deflected slightly eastward. Note that all four definitions are
equivalent at the poles. And the first three are equivalent at the equator.

10.2. Longjumping in geff

Let the jumper take off with speed v, at an angle θ . The time to the top of the motion
is given by geff (t/2) = v sin θ , so the total time is t = 2v sin θ/geff . The distance

.

(10.45)

This is maximum when θ = π/4, as we well know. So we see that d ∝ 1/geff .
Taking geff ≈ 10 m/s2 at the north pole, and geff ≈ (10 − 0.05) m/s2 at the equator,
we find that the jump at the equator is approximately 1.005 times as long as the one
at the north pole. So the longjumper gains about four centimeters. This would be
completely washed out by even the tiniest wind effect.

Remark: For a longjumper, the optimal angle of takeoff is undoubtedly not π/4.
The act of changing the direction abruptly from horizontal to such a large angle would
entail a significant loss in speed. The optimal angle is some hard-to-determine angle
less than π/4. But this won’t change our general d ∝ 1/geff result (which follows
from dimensional analysis). However, we’ve also made the assumption that the CM
of the longjumper starts and ends at the same height, which is definitely not true in
longjumping; it is lower at the end. This in fact does change the d ∝ 1/geff result.
But using the result from Problem 3.17, we see that the effect is small (using values
of h ≈ 1 m and v ≈ 10 m/s). ♣

10.3. geff vs. g

The forces mg and Fcent are shown in Fig. 10.22. The magnitude of Fcent
is
mRω2 sin θ, so the component of Fcent perpendicular to mg is mRω2 sin θ cos θ =
mRω2(sin 2θ)/2. For small Fcent, maximizing the angle between geff and g is equiva-
lent to maximizing this perpendicular component. Therefore, we obtain the maximum
angle when sin 2θ = 1 =⇒ θ = π/4. The maximum angle turns out to be

φ ≈ tan φ ≈

/mg = Rω2/2g ≈ 1.7 · 10

(10.46)
which is about 0.1◦. Because the earth bulges at the equator, the distance from the
axis isn’t exactly R sin θ, the angle of g isn’t exactly θ (see the first remark at the end
of Section 10.2.2), and the magnitude of g isn’t exactly constant over the surface of
the earth. But these effects are negligible, and the optimal θ is still essentially π/4.

−3,

Remark: The above solution is an approximate one which is valid only when the
magnitude of Fcent is much smaller than mg. We’ll now give an exact solution which
is valid when the magnitude of Fcent is comparable to mg, but which is valid only in
the unrealistic case where the planet is a perfect sphere, even though it is spinning.
No planet would ever take a spherical shape, because planets aren’t rigid. But you
could imagine a large spherical rock.

To solve the problem exactly, we can break Fcent into components parallel and
perpendicular to g and make use of the parallel component, in addition to the perpen-
dicular component we used above. If φ is the angle between geff and g, then from
Fig. 10.22 we have

We can then maximize φ by taking a derivative. But we need to be careful if Rω2 > g,
in which case maximizing φ doesn’t mean maximizing tan φ. You can work this out,
and we’ll instead give the following slick geometric solution.

In Fig. 10.23, draw the Fcent vectors for various θ , relative to mg (so we’ve chosen
mg always to be vertical in this figure, in contrast with Fcent always being horizontal
in Fig. 10.22). Since the lengths of the Fcent vectors are proportional to sin θ , you
can show that the tips of the Fcent vectors form a circle. The maximum φ is therefore
achieved when geff is tangent to this circle, as shown in Fig. 10.24. In the limit where
g (cid:6) Rω2 (that is, in the limit of a small circle), we want the point of tangency to

be the rightmost point on the circle, so the maximum φ is achieved when θ = π/4,
in which case φ ≈ sin φ ≈ (Rω2/2)/g, as we found above. But in the general case,

In the limit of small ω, this is approximately Rω2/2g, as above. Note that this
reasoning holds only if Rω2 < g. In the case where Rω2 > g (that is, the circle
extends above the top end of the mg segment), the maximum φ is simply π, and it is
achieved at θ = π/2. ♣

10.4. Lots of circles

(a) The fictitious force, Ff , on the mass has an Fcent part and an Ftrans part, because

the center of C2 is moving. So the fictitious force is

Ff = mω2r2 + Ftrans,

(10.49)

where r2 is the position of the mass in the frame of C2. But Ftrans, which arises
from the acceleration of the center of C2, equals the centrifugal force felt by a
point on C1. Therefore,

Ftrans = mω2r1,

(10.50)

where r1 is the position of the center of C2 in the frame of C1. Substituting this
into Eq. (10.49) gives

Ff = mω2(r2 + r1) = mω2R(t).

(10.51)

(b) The fictitious force, Ff , on the mass has an Fcent part and an Ftrans part, because

the center of the N th circle is moving. So the fictitious force is

Ff = mω2rN + Ftrans,N ,

(10.52)

where rN is the position of the mass in the frame of CN . But Ftrans,N equals the
centrifugal force felt by a point on the (N −1)th circle, plus the translation force
coming from the movement of the center of the (N − 1)th circle. Therefore,
Ftrans,N = mω2rN −1 + Ftrans,N −1.

(10.53)

Substituting this into Eq. (10.52) and successively rewriting the Ftrans,i terms
in a similar manner, gives

Ff = mω2(rN + rN −1 + · · · + r1) = mω2R(t).
(10.54)
This turns out so clean because Fcent is linear in r, and also because all the ω’s
are the same.

Remark: A much easier way to see that Ff = mω2R(t) is the following. Since
all the circles rotate with the same ω, they may as well all be glued together.
Such a rigid setup does indeed yield the same ω for all the circles, just as in the
case of the moon rotating once on its axis for every revolution it makes around
the earth, thereby causing the same side to always face the earth. It is then clear
that the mass simply moves in a circle at frequency ω, yielding a fictitious
centrifugal force of mω2R(t). And as a bonus, we see that the magnitude of
R(t) is constant. ♣

10.5. Mass on turntable

In the lab frame, the net force on the mass is zero, because it is sitting at rest. (The
normal force cancels the gravitational force.) But in the rotating frame, the mass
travels in a circle of radius r with frequency ω. So its speed is v = ωr. Therefore, in

10.6 Solutions

489

the rotating frame there must be a net force of mv2/r = mω2r inward to account for
the centripetal acceleration. And indeed, the mass feels a centrifugal force of mω2r
outward, and a Coriolis force of 2mωv = 2mω2r inward, which sum to the desired
force (see Fig. 10.25).
Remark: The net inward force in this problem is a little different from the force on a
person swinging around in a circle of radius r and frequency ω in an inertial frame. If
a skater, for example, maintains a circular path by holding a rope whose other end is
attached to a pole, then she has to use her muscles to maintain the position of her torso
with respect to her arm, and her head with respect to her torso, etc. But if a person
takes the place of the mass in the present problem, then she doesn’t need to exert any
effort at all to keep her body moving in the circle (which is clear, when viewed from
the inertial frame), because each atom in her body is moving at (essentially) the same
speed and radius, and therefore feels the same centrifugal and Coriolis forces. So she
doesn’t really feel the net force of mω2r, in the same sense that someone doesn’t feel
gravity when in free-fall with no air resistance, because gravity acts on each bit of
mass in the same way. (As mentioned on page 462, this similarity with gravity is
what led Einstein to his Equivalence Principle.) ♣

10.6. Released mass

Let the x(cid:16) and y(cid:16) axes of the rotating frame coincide with the x and y axes of the inertial
frame at the moment the mass is released (at t = 0). Let the mass initially be located
on the x(cid:16) axis. Then after a time t, the situation looks like that in Fig. 10.26. The speed
of the mass is v = aω, so it has traveled a distance aωt. The angle that its position
vector makes with the inertial x axis is therefore tan−1 ωt, with counterclockwise
taken to be positive. Hence, the angle that its position vector makes with the rotating
x(cid:16) axis is

10.7. Coriolis circles

By construction (with the surface being orthogonal to geff at all points), the normal
force from the ice exactly cancels all effects of the gravitational and centrifugal forces
in the rotating frame of the earth. We therefore need only concern ourselves with the
Coriolis force, −2mω × v.

Let the angle down from the north pole be θ. We’re assuming that the circle is
small enough so that θ is essentially constant throughout the motion. The compo-
nent of the Coriolis force that points horizontally along the surface has magnitude
f = 2mv(ω cos θ) and is perpendicular to the direction of motion. (The vertical com-
ponent of the Coriolis force, which comes from the component of ω that points along
the surface, simply modifies the required normal force.) Because this force is per-
pendicular to the direction of motion, v does not change. Therefore, f = 2mvω cos θ
is constant. But a constant force perpendicular to the motion of a particle produces a
circular path.19 The radius of the circle is given by

Accelerating frames of reference

To get a rough idea of the size of the circle, you can show (using ω ≈ 7.3 · 10−5 s−1)
that r ≈ 10 km when v = 1 m/s and θ = 45◦. Even the tiniest bit of friction will
clearly make this effect impossible to see. In the special case of θ ≈ π/2 (that is,
near the equator), the component of the Coriolis force along the surface is negligible,
so r becomes large, and ω(cid:16) goes to 0.

In the limit θ ≈ 0 (that is, near the north pole), the Coriolis force essentially
Remark:
points along the surface. The above equations give r ≈ v/(2ω), and ω(cid:16) ≈ 2ω. For
the special case where the center of the circle is the north pole, this ω(cid:16) ≈ 2ω result
might seem incorrect, because you might want to say that the circular motion should
be achieved by having the puck remain motionless in the inertial fame, while the
earth rotates beneath it (thus making ω(cid:16) = ω). The error in this reasoning is that the
“level” earth is not spherical, due to the nonradial direction of geff . If the puck starts
out motionless in the inertial frame, it will be drawn toward the north pole, due to the
component of the gravitational force along the nonspherical “level” earth. In order
not to fall toward the pole, the puck needs to travel with frequency ω (relative to the
inertial frame) in the direction opposite20 to the earth’s rotation. The reason for this is
that in the rotating frame of the puck, the puck feels the same centrifugal force that it
would feel if it were at rest in the frame of the earth, spinning along with it, because
these two frames have the same magnitude of ω; the ω’s point in opposite directions,
but this doesn’t affect the centrifugal force. The puck therefore happily stays at the
same θ value on the “level” surface, just as a puck at rest on the earth does. The angular
velocity of the puck with respect to the earth is therefore (−ω) − (ω) = −2ω, where
the minus sign signifies the backward direction. ♣

CM

agrees with the second term in Eq. (8.45), where r(cid:16)
CM is written as R − r0. The three
conditions under which the third term vanishes are therefore: (1) r(cid:16)
= 0, that is, the
CM is located at the origin of the accelerating frame. The fictitious translation force
acts just like a gravitational force, so as far as the torque is concerned, the translation
force acts at the CM. Therefore, if the CM is located at the origin, the translation
force has no lever arm and thus provides no torque. (2) ¨r0 = 0, that is, the origin is
not accelerating, so there is no translation force. (3) r(cid:16)
CM is parallel to ¨r0. This means
that if the translation force is considered to be a gravitational force, then the CM lies
directly “above” or “below” the origin. So there is no lever arm and thus no torque.
If the frame is rotating in addition to translating, then in general there will be
torques from the centrifugal, Coriolis, and azimuthal forces, even if the CM is chosen
as the origin. This is true because these fictitious forces involve r (or ˙r), which results
in the torque not being linear in r (because there is already an r in τ = r × F). This
then means that the r(cid:16)
CM position vector doesn’t arise in the calculation of dL/dt as it
did in Eq. (10.61).

10.9. Determining your frame

Yes. You can determine ω and dω/dt as follows. Simultaneously measure the forces
on particles of mass m at rest at positions r1 and r2. The centrifugal and azimuthal
are the relevant forces, so the difference in the forces at the two locations is

(cid:16)F ≡ F1 − F2 = −mω × (ω × (r1 − r2)) − m

dω
dt

× (r1 − r2).

(10.62)

Using the fact that the cross product of two vectors is perpendicular to each vector,
we see that the magnitudes of the components of (cid:16)F parallel and perpendicular to
r1 − r2 are F(cid:23) = mω2|r1 − r2| and F⊥ = m(dω/dt)|r1 − r2|. So we have

(cid:13)

ω =

F(cid:23)
m|r1 − r2| ,

and

dω
dt

=

F⊥
m|r1 − r2| .

(10.63)

These expressions give ω and dω/dt in terms of measured quantities. Note that we
needed to measure the force at two points here. Measuring the force of −mω × (ω ×
r) − m(dω/dt) × r at only one point r doesn’t give us anything, because we don’t
yet know where the origin is, so we don’t know the value of r. But with two points,
the difference r1 − r2 is independent of the location of the origin.

If you want, you can check the result for ω by finding the difference between
the forces on two objects at essentially the same location, one of which is at rest
and the other of which is moving with velocity v. Because the r values are the same,
only the Coriolis term survives in the difference. This gives ω = |(cid:16)F|/(2mv).

To find the center of the disk, measure the force on a particle at a given location.
Break this force into orthogonal components in the ratio of dω/dt to ω2, by drawing
a line at an angle of tan−1((dω/dt)/ω2) with respect to the force. Whether this line
is to the right or to the left of the force depends on whether the r1 − r2 vector above
was to the right or to the left of the (cid:16)F vector. This line contains the component
proportional to ω2, which is the radial component. The line therefore passes through
the center of the disk. So if we repeat the process with the particle at another location
(not along the line) and draw a similar line, then the intersection of the two lines is
the center of the disk.

Remark:
If we remove the restriction that there aren’t any real forces, then it isn’t
possible to determine the three desired quantities, because someone could claim that
ω, dω/dt, and the location of the center are different from what you found, and he
could then just say that there are a bunch of (contrived) real forces that conspire to
make the total force be what you observe. ♣

later. Let P(cid:16) be the point that is now directly below Q (see Fig. 10.28). The
angular speed of the cone is ω, so Q moves horizontally with speed vQ = ωh.
Therefore, in the infinitesimal time t, Q moves a distance ωht to the side.

This distance ωht is also (essentially) the horizontal distance between P and

P(cid:16). Therefore, a little geometry tells us that P is now a height

above the table. Since P started on the table with zero speed, this means that
P undergoes an acceleration of ω2h in the vertical direction. A mass m located
at P must therefore feel a real force (normal force or whatever) of FP = mω2h
in the upward direction, if it is to remain motionless with respect to the cone.
(b) The precession frequency (cid:18) (which is how fast ω swings around the origin)
is equal to the speed of Q divided by r, where r is the distance from Q to
the z axis (that is, the radius of the circle Q travels in). Therefore, (cid:3) has
magnitude vQ/r = ωh/r, and it points in the −ˆz direction, for the situation
shown in Fig. 10.27. Hence, dω/dt = (cid:3) × ω has magnitude ω2h/r, and it
points out of the page in Fig. 10.27 (or to the left in Fig. 10.28). Therefore,
Faz = −m(dω/dt) × r has magnitude mω2h, and it points in the −ˆz direction.
A person of mass m at point P therefore interprets the situation as, “I am
not accelerating with respect to the cone. Therefore, the net force on me in the
cone frame is zero. And indeed, the upward normal force FP from the cone,
with magnitude mω2h, is exactly balanced by the mysterious downward force
Faz, also with magnitude mω2h.”

Note that this azimuthal force is still basically the same effect as with the
translation force, the centrifugal force, and the simpler case of the azimuthal
force discussed in Section 10.2.4. In all of these cases, the “ground” accelerates,
so you feel like you are getting flung in the opposite direction with respect to
the accelerating frame.

10.11. Unwinding string

Consider the clockwise direction. This case is easily solved by working in the lab
frame. After the glue breaks, the mass moves in the straight line of the tangent, because
the string can’t provide a transverse force unless the mass has already diverged from
this straight line, which it hasn’t. The speed at which the mass starts this straight-line
motion (when the glue breaks) is Rω. And it continues to move at this speed because
the angular speed of the wheel allows the string to unwind at a rate Rω, which is
exactly the rate needed. Note that the string has zero tension in it, so it’s just like it’s
not there.

The counterclockwise direction is tricker, because simple linear motion isn’t con-
sistent with the constraint that the mass stays tied to the string. There is now a tension
in the string, and the mass undergoes a spiral motion, which makes things more dif-
ficult. It’s possible to solve this problem with F = ma, and also with the Lagrangian
method. But we’ll solve it here by using a slick argument in a rotating frame. Part
of the trickiness of this approach is choosing which rotating frame to use. The most
obvious frame is the rotating frame of the wheel, but this frame isn’t too helpful,
because the mass undergoes a spiral motion which is hard to get a handle on (how-
ever, see the fourth remark below). It would be nice to work in a frame where the
mass undergoes a simple kind of motion. It turns out that if we consider the frame
that rotates counterclockwise at 2ω instead of ω, things turn out to be simple.

10.6 Solutions

493

The general idea is the following. In this new frame that rotates counterclockwise
at 2ω, the wheel rotates clockwise at ω. Therefore, if there were no such things as
fictitious forces, then we would have exactly the same situation as in the clockwise
case we solved above, so we would be done. The bad news, however, is that fictitious
forces do exist. And so without any miraculous cancellation, these forces will lead
to a transverse force, causing the string’s contact point to move one way or another,
thereby causing the unwound length to increase at a rate other than Rω. But the good
news is that such a miraculous cancellation does indeed occur. Let’s see why.

In the frame that rotates counterclockwise at 2ω, consider the moment right after the
mass leaves the wheel, as shown in Fig. 10.29. The velocity of the mass at this time is
v = Rω, directed to the right. What are the forces on the mass? There may be a tension
(it happens to be zero right at the start, but then it grows, as we’ll see below), and then
there are also the centrifugal and Coriolis forces. The centrifugal force is initially (right
when the glue breaks) directed radially upward with magnitude mR(2ω)2 = 4mRω2.
The Coriolis force is (as you can verify) initially directed downward with magnitude
2m(2ω)v = 2m(2ω)(Rω) = 4mRω2. These two forces cancel, so the mass feels no
transverse force, so it continues to move in a straight line to the right.

What about a later time? Assume (in an inductive spirit) that the mass is still on the
straight line determined by its initial motion and moving with speed Rω. The Coriolis
force is still directed downward with magnitude 4mRω2. And the centrifugal force is
directed radially outward with magnitude mr(2ω)2, where r is the present radius, as
shown in Fig. 10.30. The vertical component of this force is obtained by multiplying
by R/r, so we again obtain an upward vertical component of 4mRω2. This therefore
cancels the Coriolis force, and we again have the result that there is no transverse
force. So we see that if the mass is presently moving in the straight line determined by
its initial motion, then it will continue to move in this straight line. And since it is by
definition initially moving in this line, we see inductively that it moves in this line for
all time, as we wanted to show. Note that the horizontal component of the centrifugal
force needs to be canceled by the tension (because the string doesn’t stretch), so the
tension is nonzero in this scenario, in contrast with the clockwise scenario above.
Since the string is always taut, the speed of the mass is determined by the rate at
which the wheel rotates, which means that the speed of the mass is always Rω in this
frame. The rate of increase in the unwound string’s length is therefore Rω (in any
frame).

Remarks:

1. The tension equals the longitudinal component of the centrifugal force. This
component is obtained by multiplying the centrifugal force by d/r, where d is
the length of unwound string. The tension therefore equals 4mdω2, so it grows
linearly with d.

2. Even if the string is massive, and even if the density varies, the unwound length
still increases at a rate Rω, because the above reasoning can be used with every
atom in the string. This result is a bit surprising, because when viewed in the
lab frame, it is by no means obvious that a massive string remains straight.
3. If we hadn’t been told in the statement of the problem that the unwound string’s
length increases at a rate Rω, then the problem would of course be more difficult.
For all we’d know, the rate might not even be constant. Aside from making a
lucky guess that the rate is Rω, we’d have to solve the problem with F = ma or
the Lagrangian method. The former is rather tricky, but the latter isn’t so bad.
4. There’s actually an even slicker solution for the counterclockwise case than the
one we gave above. It goes as follows. First consider the simpler clockwise
case, and look at the setup in the rotating frame of the wheel. It this case, the
centrifugal and Coriolis forces conspire to make the mass move in a backward
spiral, the beginning of which is shown in Fig. 10.31. We know from our lab-
frame reasoning above that in the lab frame the string provides no force during

Now consider the more difficult counterclockwise case in the rotating frame
of the wheel. The only difference from the clockwise case is that the ω vec-
tor has switched direction, and now points out of the page. The centrifugal
force is therefore still the same function of r, but the Coriolis force has
switched signs, as a function of v. However, the centrifugal force is the only
force that does work on the mass (because the Coriolis force and the ten-
sion are perpendicular to the velocity), so the mass ends up moving at the
same speed as a function of r as in the clockwise case. The string constrains
the mass to move along the same path as in the clockwise case (because the
string is straight in both cases), and the only effect of the Coriolis force is
to increase the tension. The motion is therefore exactly the same (same path,
same speed as a function of r), so the rate of change of the unwound length is
again Rω. ♣

10.12. Shape of the earth

(a) The potential energy function derived from the sum of the gravitational and
centrifugal forces must be constant along the surface. Otherwise, a piece of the
earth would want to move along the surface, which would mean that we didn’t
have the correct surface to begin with.

If x is the distance from the earth’s axis,

then the centrifugal force is
Fc = mω2x, directed outward. The potential energy function for this force
is Vc = −mω2x2/2, up to an arbitrary additive constant. Under the assumption
that the distortion of the earth doesn’t change the gravitational force (which isn’t
correct, as we’ll see below), the potential energy for the gravitation force is mgh,
where we’ve arbitrarily chosen the original spherical surface to correspond to
h = 0. The equal-potential condition is therefore

mgh − mω2x2

2

= C,

where C is a constant to be determined. Using x = r sin θ , we obtain

h =

ω2r2 sin2θ
2g

+ B,

(10.65)

(10.66)

where B ≡ C/(mg) is another constant. We may replace the r here with the
radius of the earth, R, with negligible error.

Depending what the constant B is, this equation describes a whole family
of surfaces. We can determine the correct value of B by demanding that the
volume of the distorted earth be the same as it would be in its spherical shape if
the centrifugal force were turned off. This is equivalent to demanding that the
integral of h over the surface of the earth is zero. The integral of (a sin2θ + b)
over the surface of the earth is (the integral is easy if we write sin2θ as 1−cos2θ )

(b) For convenience,

let the correct height be h ≡ β(3 sin2θ − 2), with

β ≡ fR(Rω2/6g), where f is the desired fraction.

Consider the earth to be the superposition of the h = 0 sphere plus an
effective shell of positive or negative mass, depending on the sign of h at
a given location. The potential energy of a mass m at a given point on the
surface of the distorted earth is the sum of the potentials due to (1) gravity
from the sphere, (2) the centrifugal force, and (3) gravity from the shell. From
Eq. (10.68), the standard mgh contributions from (1) at a pole and the equator
are essentially mgβ(−2) and mgβ(1), respectively. The contributions from (2)
at a pole and the equator are 0 and −mω2R2/2, respectively. The contributions
from (3) are trickier. We need to calculate the integral −
Gm dM /(cid:2), where
dM runs over the shell, and (cid:2) is the distance from m to each dM . The mass of
a small element in the shell is

The distance from the north pole to a point with polar angle θ equals

2(1 − cos θ). Using the Pythagorean theorem, the
distance from a point on the equator, say (R, 0, 0), to a point with polar
angle θ whose general form is (R sin θ cos φ, R sin θ sin φ, R cos θ ) equals
2(1 − sin θ cos φ). Demanding that the total potential at the north

Accelerating frames of reference

Evaluating this integral numerically gives essentially 0.6, which then yields
f = 5/2, as desired.

Remark: The f = 5/2 result leads to a difference in polar and equatorial radii
of (cid:16)h = (5/2)(R2ω2/6g)(3) ≈ 28 000 m = 28 km. The fact that this is larger
than the correct value of 21.5 km makes sense for the following reason. If all
of the earth’s mass were concentrated at the center, then the thin distortion
shell at the surface would have no effect on the potential, because it would be
massless. So the naive calculation in part (a) would in fact be correct, and (cid:16)h
would be about 11 km. The actual density of the earth decreases with radius,
which means that the density lies somewhere between the case of a concentrated
center and the case of uniform density. The actual value of (cid:16)h should therefore
lie somewhere between the corresponding (cid:16)h values of 11 km and 28 km. And
21.5 km indeed does. ♣

10.13. Southward deflection

The Coriolis force is 2mωv sin θ eastward. But v ≈ gt, so the eastward acceleration is
2ωgt sin θ. Integrating this gives an eastward speed of ωgt2 sin θ . This eastward speed
produces a Coriolis force in the direction away from the earth’s axis, so the accelera-
tion in this direction is 2ω(ωgt2 sin θ ). The component of this acceleration along the
surface of the earth (that is, in the southward direction) is 2ω2gt2 sin θ cos θ . Integrat-
ing this gives a southward speed of (2/3)ω2gt3 sin θ cos θ . Integrating again gives a
southward deflection of (1/6)ω2gt4 sin θ cos θ . But gt2/2 ≈ h =⇒ t2 ≈ 2h/g. So
the southward deflection due to the Coriolis force is (2/3)(ω2h2/g) sin θ cos θ .

Now for the rest of the problem. To be precise, we’ll define θ to be the polar angle
at the point P on the radial line to the dropping point. However, we would still obtain
the same answer if we defined θ to be the polar angle at the location of the plumb
bob, because the difference between these two angles is of order ω2 (since it is due
to the centrifugal contribution to the effective gravity). And this difference yields a
negligible effect of order ω4 in the 4(ω2h2/g) sin θ cos θ result, because this already
contains a factor of ω2.

(a) At point P, the magnitude of Fcent is mω2R sin θ , so (using Fig. 10.22 in
the solution to Problem 10.3) the component of Fcent perpendicular to mg is
F ⊥
= mω2R sin θ cos θ . The angle that geff makes with the radial at P is
cent
therefore essentially equal to F ⊥
/mg = (ω2R/g) sin θ cos θ . However, the
cent
direction of the plumb bob line is determined by the geff vector at the location
of the plumb bob (call this point B), and not at P; see Fig. 10.32. Now, the
angle we just found between geff and g (that is, the radial) at P is the same as
the angle between geff and g at B (at least to order ω2, by the argument in the
preceding paragraph). Therefore, since the g vector at B is tilted at the angle β
(shown) relative to the g vector at P, we see that geff at B makes an angle of
φ = (ω2R/g) sin θ cos θ − β relative to the radial at P. The angle β is given
by d/R, where d is the distance between P and B. So in the thin triangle DPB,
the relation d ≈ hφ gives

(c) At height y, the distance from the center of the earth is R + y. So from
cent reasoning in part (a), the acceleration in the southward direction

the F ⊥
is ¨z = ω2(R + y) sin θ cos θ.

(d) If the ball is a distance z away from the radial line through P (call this line
L), then the radial line to the ball makes an angle of approximately z/R with
respect to L. The component of the gravitational force on the ball perpendicular
to L is therefore ¨z = −g(z/R), where the minus sign signifies toward L (that
is, northward).

(e) Parts (c) and (d) give

¨z = ω2(R + y) sin θ cos θ − g(z/R).

(10.80)

so to leading order we have ¨z =
The R term here dominates,

as we wanted to show. From the third line in Eq. (10.82), we see that the 7/3
result can be broken up into a 5/3 that comes from the extra time it takes the
ball to hit the ground due to the decrease in the gravitational force with altitude,
a 5/6 that comes from the dependence of the centrifugal force on height, and
a −1/6 that comes from the slightly northward component of the gravitational
force.

Remark: We can also solve this problem by working in an inertial frame. In this
frame, the ball has an initial sideways motion due to the rotation of the earth, and this
motion causes the ball to travel in the path shown in Fig. 10.33. Because only gravity
acts on the ball, its path lies in the plane determined by its initial velocity and radius.
The intersection of this plane with the surface of the earth is the great circle shown,
and the ball hits the earth at a point A on this great circle.

The distance (cid:2) that the ball travels along the great circle is essentially equal to the
distance it travels in the eastward direction (that is, along the latitude circle). This
eastward distance equals the distance that point P rotates due to the spinning of the
earth, plus the extra Coriolis eastward deflection dcor that we found in Eq. (10.18).
(In the spirit of working in an inertial frame, let’s assume that we found this deflection
by the method given in the remark after Eq. (10.18).) So we have (cid:2) ≈ R sin θ ωt +dcor.
The task now is to determine the distance between A and the latitude circle through
P. This distance should equal the result in Eq. (10.82) plus the southward Coriolis
deflection. (We’ll then subtract off the distance from the pendulum bob to P, given
in Eq. (10.74), as we did above.)21 This task is equivalent to answering the question:
If a circle of radius r = R sin θ (the latitude circle) sits on a plane (the plane of the
great circle) and is inclined at an angle θ with respect to the normal to the plane, how
far above the plane is a point on the circle with an “x” coordinate equal to (cid:2) (with
r2 − (cid:2)2 in the right
(cid:2) (cid:4) r)? Using a Taylor series approximation for the length
triangle in Fig. 10.34, we see that if the circle is perpendicular to the plane, then the
desired distance is (cid:2)2/2r. Tilting the circle by an angle θ simply brings in a factor of
cos θ, so the distance is ((cid:2)2/2r) cos θ = ((cid:2)2/2R sin θ ) cos θ .

√

21 If you want, you can derive the distance from the pendulum bob to P by working in the inertial
frame, to maintain the spirit of this solution. The mω2R type term we found in part (a) above
simply shows up through the centripetal acceleration instead of through the centrifugal force.

10.14. Bead on a hoop

(a) The gravitational force on the bead is essentially GMm/(R − r)2, directed
essentially to the right. But to leading order, we can neglect the r here. If the
bead is at an angle θ up from the horizontal, then we need to multiply this
rightward force by sin θ ≈ θ to obtain the force component along the hoop.

We’ll calculate the effect due to the sun, and then multiply by 3 to obtain the total
effect, because the moon’s effect is twice the sun’s. Consider the case where the earth
is in the summer/winter orientation. From Eq. (10.35), the tidal force on the effective
point mass m is (GMSm/R3)(2x, −y). Both components are relevant here, so the tidal
forces on the two masses are shown in Fig. 10.35, where r is the radius of the earth,

This answer actually came out a little too good. We had no right to expect that it would
come out so close to 26 000 years, considering the various approximations we made.
But we did have a right to expect it to come out within a factor of, say, 5 or so, because
our approximations could be off by only so much. At any rate, Eq. (10.92) does at least
give the correct dependence on the various parameters. Note that Eq. (10.40) says
that h ∝ r2ω2
/g. Using this along with g = G(4πr3ρE/3)/r2 in Eq. (10.92), and
3
ignoring all numerical factors, gives (cid:18) ∝ ω3MS/(ρER3) ∝ ω3(MS/Mc), where Mc
is the mass of a colossal object whose density equals the earth’s and whose radius
equals the earth–sun distance. (This relation also holds if we consider the moon
instead of the sun.)

Interestingly, the time of T = 26 000 years is large enough to allow us to
Remark:
treat the axis of rotation as essentially constant, but small enough to have a noticeable
effect over the ages. The star we see in the northern direction nowadays is a different
northern star from the one people saw, say, 2000 years ago. And the signs of the
zodiac that we see now are shifted by approximately one place compared with what
they were 2000 years ago. The “precession of the equinoxes” name comes from the
fact that if you consider, for example, a distant galaxy that the sun blocks out when the
earth is in the spring equinox position now, and if you consider the analogous galaxy
13 000 years ago, then the two galaxies are in opposite directions in the universe,
relative to the earth. ♣

22 The mass m is actually smaller than this, because the earth’s crust is less dense than its interior.
But I3 is smaller than this too, because the earth’s core is denser than the mantle. These effects
somewhat cancel each other, because m appears in the numerator and I3 appears in the denominator.
But we’re just doing things roughly anyway.

Chapter 11
Relativity (Kinematics)

We now come to Einstein’s theory of relativity. This is where we find out
that everything we’ve done so far in this book has been wrong. Well, per-
haps “incomplete” would be a better word. The important point to realize is
that Newtonian physics is a limiting case of the more correct relativistic theory.
Newtonian physics works perfectly fine when the speeds we’re dealing with are
much less than the speed of light, which is about 3 · 108 m/s. It would be silly, to
put it mildly, to use relativity to solve a problem involving the length of a baseball
trajectory. But in problems involving large speeds, or in problems where a high
degree of accuracy is required, we must use the relativistic theory.1 This is the
subject of the remainder of this book.

The theory of relativity is certainly one of the most exciting and talked-about
topics in physics. It is well known for its “paradoxes,” which are quite con-
ducive to discussion. There is, however, nothing at all paradoxical about it. The
theory is logically and experimentally sound, and the whole subject is actually
quite straightforward, provided that you proceed calmly and keep a firm hold of
your wits.

The theory rests upon certain postulates. The one that most people find coun-
terintuitive is that the speed of light has the same value in any inertial (that is,
nonaccelerating) reference frame. This speed is much greater than the speed of
everyday objects, so most of the consequences of this new theory aren’t notice-
able. If we instead lived in a world identical to ours except for the fact that
the speed of light was 50 mph, then the consequences of relativity would be
ubiquitous. We wouldn’t think twice about time dilations, length contractions,
and so on.

I have included a large number of puzzles and “paradoxes” in the problems and
exercises. When attacking these, be sure to follow them through to completion,
and don’t say, “I could finish this one if I wanted to, but all I’d have to do would
be such-and-such, so I won’t bother,” because the essence of the paradox may

1 You shouldn’t feel too bad about having spent so much time learning about a theory that’s just
the limiting case of another theory, because you’re now going to do it again. Relativity is also the
limiting case of another theory (quantum field theory). And likewise, quantum field theory is the
limiting case of yet another theory (string theory). And likewise . . . well, you get the idea. Who
knows, maybe it really is turtles all the way down.

very well be contained in the such-and-such, and you will have missed out on all
the fun. Most of the paradoxes arise because different frames of reference seem
to give different results. Therefore, in explaining a paradox, you not only need
to give the correct reasoning, you also need to say what’s wrong with incorrect
reasoning.

There are two main topics in relativity. One is Special Relativity (which doesn’t
deal with gravity), and the other is General Relativity (which does). We’ll deal
mostly with the former, but Chapter 14 contains some of the latter. Special
Relativity may be divided into two topics, kinematics and dynamics. Kinematics
deals with lengths, times, speeds, etc. It is concerned only with the space and
time coordinates of an abstract particle, and not with masses, forces, energy,
momentum, etc. Dynamics, on the other hand, does deal with these quantities.
This chapter covers kinematics. Chapter 12 covers dynamics. Most of the fun
paradoxes fall into the kinematics part, so the present chapter is the longer of the
two. In Chapter 13, we’ll introduce the concept of 4-vectors, which ties much of
the material in Chapters 11 and 12 together.

11.1 Motivation

Although it was obviously a stroke of genius that led Einstein to his theory
of relativity, it didn’t just come out of the blue. A number of things going on
in nineteenth-century physics suggested that something was amiss. There were
many efforts made by many people to explain away the troubles that were arising,
and at least a few steps had been taken toward the correct theory. But Einstein
was the one who finally put everything together, and he did so in a way that
had consequences far beyond the realm of the specific issues that people were
trying to understand. Indeed, his theory turned our idea of space and time on its
head. But before we get into the heart of the theory, let’s look at two of the major
problems in late nineteenth-century physics.2

11.1.1 Galilean transformations, Maxwell’s equations

Imagine standing on the ground and watching a train travel by with constant
speed v in the x direction. Let the train frame be S(cid:16) and the ground frame be S, as
shown in Fig. 11.1. Consider two events that happen on the train. For example,
one person claps her hands, and another person stomps his feet. If the space
and time separations between these two events in the frame of the train are (cid:16)x(cid:16)
and (cid:16)t(cid:16), what are the space and time separations, (cid:16)x and (cid:16)t, in the frame of
the ground? Ignoring what we’ll be learning about relativity in this chapter, the
answers are “obvious” (well, in that incorrectly obvious sort of way, as we’ll see

2 If you can’t wait to get to the postulates and results of Special Relativity, you can go straight to

Section 11.2. The present section can be skipped on a first reading.

in Section 11.4.1). The time separation, (cid:16)t, is the same as on the train, so we have
(cid:16)t = (cid:16)t(cid:16). We know from everyday experience that nothing strange happens with
time. When you see people exiting a train station, they’re not fiddling with their
watches, trying to recalibrate them with a ground-based clock.

The spatial separation is a little more exciting, but still nothing too compli-
cated. The train is moving, so everything in it (in particular, the second event)
gets carried along at speed v during the time (cid:16)t(cid:16) between the two events. So we
have (cid:16)x = (cid:16)x(cid:16) + v(cid:16)t(cid:16). As a special case, if the two events happen at the same
place on the train (so that (cid:16)x(cid:16) = 0), then we have (cid:16)x = v(cid:16)t(cid:16). This makes sense,
because the spot on the train where the events occur simply travels a distance
v(cid:16)t by the time the second event happens. The Galilean transformations are
therefore

(cid:16) + v(cid:16)t
(cid:16)x = (cid:16)x
(cid:16)
(cid:16)t = (cid:16)t

.

(cid:16)

,

(11.1)

Also, nothing interesting happens in the y and z directions, so we have (cid:16)y = (cid:16)y(cid:16)
and (cid:16)z = (cid:16)z(cid:16).

The principle of Galilean invariance says that the laws of physics are invariant
under the above Galilean transformations. Alternatively, it says that the laws
of physics hold in all inertial frames.3 This is quite believable. For example,
Newton’s second law holds in all inertial frames, because the constant relative
velocity between any two frames implies that the acceleration of a given particle
is the same in all frames.

Remarks: Note that the Galilean transformations aren’t symmetric in x and t. This isn’t auto-
matically a bad thing, but it turns out that it will in fact be a problem in Special Relativity,
where space and time are treated on a more equal footing. We’ll find in Section 11.4.1 that the
Galilean transformations are replaced by the Lorentz transformations (at least in the world we
live in), and the latter are indeed symmetric in x and t (up to factors of the speed of light, c).

Note also that Eq. (11.1) deals only with the differences in x and t between two events, and
not with the values of the coordinates themselves. The values of the coordinates of a single
event depend on where you pick your origin, which is an arbitrary choice. The coordinate
differences between two events, however, are independent of this choice, and this allows us to
make the physically meaningful statement in Eq. (11.1). It makes no sense for a physical result
to depend on the arbitrary choice of origin, and so the Lorentz transformations we derive later
on will also involve only differences in coordinates. ♣

One of the great triumphs of nineteenth-century physics was the theory of
electromagnetism. In 1864, James Clerk Maxwell wrote down a set of equations
that collectively described everything that was known about the subject. These
equations involve the electric and magnetic fields through their space and time
derivatives. We won’t worry about the specific form of the equations here,4 but it

3 It was assumed prior to Einstein that these two statements say the same thing, but we will soon see

that they do not. The second statement is the one that remains valid in relativity.

4 Maxwell’s original formulation involved a large number of equations, but these were later written

more compactly, using vectors, as four equations.

504

Relativity (Kinematics)

turns out that if you transform them from one frame to another via the Galilean
transformations, they end up taking a different form. That is, if you’ve written
down Maxwell’s equations in one frame (where they take their standard nice-
looking form), and if you then replace the coordinates in this frame by those
in another frame, using Eq. (11.1), then the equations look different (and not
so nice). This presents a major problem. If Maxwell’s equations take a nice
form in one frame and a not-so-nice form in every other frame, then why is
one frame special? Said in another way, Maxwell’s equations predict that light
moves with a certain speed c. But which frame is this speed measured with
respect to? The Galilean transformations imply that if the speed is c with respect
to a given frame, then it is not c with respect to any other frame. The proposed
special frame where Maxwell’s equations are nice and the speed of light is c
was called the frame of the ether. We’ll talk in detail about the ether in the next
section, but what experiments showed was that light surprisingly moved with
speed c in every frame, no matter which way the frame was moving through the
supposed ether.

There were therefore two possibilities. Either something was wrong with
Maxwell’s equations, or something was wrong with the Galilean transforma-
tions. Considering how “obvious” the latter are, the natural assumption in the
late nineteenth century was that something was wrong with Maxwell’s equations,
which were quite new, after all. However, after a good deal of effort by many peo-
ple to make Maxwell’s equations fit with the Galilean transformations, Einstein
finally showed that the trouble was in fact with the latter. More precisely, in 1905
he showed that the Galilean transformations are a special case of the Lorentz
transformations, valid only when the speed involved is much less than the speed
of light.5 As we’ll see in Section 11.4.1, the coefficients in the Lorentz transfor-
mations depend on both v and the speed of light c, where the c’s appear in various
denominators. Since c is quite large (about 3 · 108 m/s) compared with everyday
speeds v, the parts of the Lorentz transformations involving c are negligible, for
any typical v. This is why no one prior to Einstein realized that the transforma-
tions had anything to do with the speed of light. Only the terms in Eq. (11.1) were
noticeable.

As he pondered the long futile fight
To make Galileo’s world right,
In a new variation
On the old transformation,
It was Einstein who first saw the light.

5 It was well known that Maxwell’s equations were invariant under the Lorentz transformations
(in contrast with their noninvariance under the Galilean transformations), but Einstein was the
first to recognize the full meaning of these transformations. Instead of being relevant only to
electromagnetism, the Lorentz transformations replaced the Galilean transformations universally.

11.1 Motivation

505

In short, the reasons why Maxwell’s equations were in conflict with the
Galilean transformations are: (1) The speed of light is what determines the scale
on which the Galilean transformations break down; (2) Maxwell’s equations
inherently involve the speed of light, because light is an electromagnetic wave.

11.1.2 Michelson–Morley experiment

As mentioned above, it was known in the late nineteenth century, after Maxwell
wrote down his equations, that light is an electromagnetic wave and that it moves
with a speed of about 3 · 108 m/s. Now, every other wave that people knew about
at the time needed a medium to propagate in. Sound waves need air, ocean waves
need water, waves on a string of course need the string, and so on. It was therefore
natural to assume that light also needed a medium to propagate in. This proposed
medium was called the ether. However, if light propagates in a given medium,
and if the speed in this medium is c, then the speed in a reference frame moving
relative to the medium will be different from c. Consider, for example, sound
waves in air. If the speed of sound in air is vsound, and if you run toward a sound
source with speed vyou, then the speed of the sound waves with respect to you
(assuming it’s a windless day) is vsound + vyou. Equivalently, if you are standing
downwind and the speed of the wind is vwind, then the speed of the sound waves
with respect to you is vsound + vwind.

If this ether really exists, then a reasonable thing to do is to try to measure
one’s speed with respect to it. This can be done in the following way (we’ll
work in terms of sound waves in air here).6 Let vs be the speed of sound in
air. Imagine two people standing on the ends of a long platform of length L
that moves at speed vp with respect to the reference frame in which the air is
at rest. One person claps, the other person claps immediately when he hears
the first clap (assume that the reaction time is negligible), and then the first
person records the total time elapsed when she hears the second clap. What is
this total time? Well, the answer is that we can’t say without knowing in which
direction the platform is moving. Is it moving parallel to its length, or transverse
to it (or somewhere in between)? Let’s look at these two basic cases. For both
of these, we’ll view the setup and do the calculation in the frame in which the
air is at rest.

Consider first the case where the platform moves parallel to its length. In the
frame of the air, assume that the person at the rear is the one who claps first. Then
it takes a time of L/(vs − vp) for the sound to reach the front person. This is true
because the sound must close the initial gap of L at a relative speed of vs − vp,

6 As we’ll soon see, there is no ether, and light travels at the same speed with respect to any frame.
This is a rather bizarre fact, and it takes some getting used to. It’s hard enough to get away from the
old way of thinking, even without any further reminders, so I can’t bring myself to work through
this method in terms of light waves in an ether. I’ll therefore work in terms of sound waves in air.

as viewed in the air frame.7 By similar reasoning, the time for the sound to return
to the rear person is L/(vs + vp). The total time is therefore

(11.2)

This correctly equals 2L/vs when vp = 0, and infinity when vp → vs.

Now consider the case where the platform moves perpendicular to its length.
In the frame of the air, we have the situation shown in Fig. 11.2. Since the sound
moves diagonally,8 the “vertical” component is (by the Pythagorean theorem)
(cid:15)
p. This is the relevant component as far as traveling the length of the

.

(11.3)

Again, this correctly equals 2L/vs when vp = 0, and infinity when vp → vs.

The times in Eqs. (11.2) and (11.3) are not equal. As an exercise, you can
show that of all the possible orientations of the platform relative to the direction
of motion, t1 is the largest possible time, and t2 is the smallest. Therefore, if
you are on a large surface that is moving with respect to the air, and if you
know the values of L and vs, then if you want to figure out what vp is (assume
that it doesn’t occur to you to toss a little piece of paper to at least find the
direction of the wind), all you have to do is repeat the above setup with someone
standing at various points along the circumference of a given circle around you.
If you take the largest total time that occurs and equate it with t1, then Eq.
(11.2) will give you vp. Alternatively, you can equate the smallest time with
t2, and Eq. (11.3) will yield the same vp. Note that if vp (cid:4) vs, we can apply
Taylor series approximations to the above two times. For future reference, these
approximations give the difference in times as

(11.4)

The above setup is the general idea that Michelson and Morley used in
1887 to measure the speed of the earth through the supposed ether.9 There is,
however, a major complication with light that doesn’t arise with sound – the
speed of light is so large that any time intervals that are individually measured
will have inevitable measurement errors that are far larger than the difference

7 Alternatively, relative to the initial back of the platform, the position of the sound wave is vst, and

the position of the front person is L + vpt. Equating these gives t = L/(vs − vp).

8 The sound actually moves in all directions, of course, but it’s only the part of the wave that moves

in a particular diagonal direction that ends up hitting the other person.

between t1 and t2. Therefore, individual time measurements give essentially no
information. Fortunately, there is a way out of this impasse.

Consider two of the above “platform” scenarios arranged to be at right angles
with respect to each other, with the same starting point. This can be arranged
by having a (monochromatic) light beam encounter a beam splitter that sends
two beams off at 90◦ angles. The beams then hit mirrors and bounce back to
the beam splitter where they (partially) recombine before hitting a screen, as
shown in Fig. 11.3. The fact that light is a wave, which is what got us into this
mess in the first place, is now what saves the day. The wave nature of light
implies that the recombined light beam produces an interference pattern on the
screen. At the center of the pattern, the beams will constructively or destructively
interfere (or something in between), depending on whether the two light beams
are in phase or out of phase when they recombine. This interference pattern is
extremely delicate. The slightest change in travel times of the beams will cause
the pattern to noticeably shift.

If the whole apparatus is rotated around, so that the experiment is performed at
various angles, then the maximum amount that the interference pattern changes
can be used to determine the speed of the earth through the ether (vp in the
platform setup above). In one extreme case, the time in one arm is longer than
the time in the other by Lv2/c3, where we have changed notation in Eq. (11.4)
so that vp → v is the speed of the earth, and vs → c is the speed of light. But in
the other extreme case, the time in this arm is shorter by Lv2/c3. So the maximal
interference shift corresponds to a time difference of 2Lv2/c3.

However, when Michelson and Morley performed their experiment, they
observed no interference shift as the apparatus was rotated around. Their setup
did in fact allow enough precision to measure a nontrivial earth speed through the
ether, if such a speed existed. So if the ether did exist, their results implied that
the speed of the earth through it was zero. This result, although improbable, was
technically fine; it might simply have been the case that they happened to do their
experiment when the relative speed was zero. However, when they performed
their experiment half a year later, when the earth’s motion around the sun caused
it to be moving in the opposite direction, they still measured zero speed. It wasn’t
possible for both of these results to be zero (assuming that the ether exists), so
something must have been wrong with the initial reasoning. Many people over
the years tried to explain this null result, but none of the explanations were sat-
isfactory. Some led to incorrect predictions in other setups, and some seemed to
work fine but were a bit ad hoc.10 The correct explanation, which followed from

10 The most successful explanation (and one that was essentially correct, although the reason why it
was correct wasn’t known until Einstein fully explained things) was the Lorentz–FitzGerald con-
traction. These two physicists independently proposed that lengths are contracted in the direction
1 − v2/c2, to make the travel times in the
of the motion by precisely the right factor, namely
two arms of the Michelson–Morley setup equal, thus yielding the null result.

(cid:4)

508

Relativity (Kinematics)

Einstein’s 1905 theory of relativity, was that the ether doesn’t exist.11 In other
words, light doesn’t need a medium to propagate in; it doesn’t move with respect
to a certain special reference frame, but rather it moves with respect to whoever
is looking at it.

The findings of Michelson–Morley
Allow us to say very surely,
“If this ether is real,
Then it has no appeal,
And shows itself off rather poorly.”

Remarks:

1. We assumed above that the lengths of the two arms in the apparatus were equal. In practice,
there is absolutely no hope of constructing the lengths to be equal, up to an error that is
sufficiently small compared with the wavelength of the light. But fortunately this doesn’t
matter. We’re concerned not with the difference in the travel times associated with the two
arms, but rather with the difference in these differences as the apparatus is rotated around.
Using Eqs. (11.2) and (11.3) with different lengths L1 and L2, you can quickly show that
the maximum interference shift corresponds to a time of (L1 +L2)v2/c3, assuming v (cid:4) c.
2. Assuming that the lengths of the arms are approximately equal, let’s plug in some rough
numbers to see how much the interference pattern shifts. The Michelson–Morley setup
had arms with lengths of about 10 m. And we’ll take v to be on the order of the speed of the
earth around the sun, which is about 3 · 104 m/s. We then obtain a maximal time change
of t = 2Lv2/c3 ≈ 7 · 10−16 s. The large negative exponent here might make us want to
throw in the towel, thinking that the effect is hopelessly small. But we should be careful
about calling a dimensionful quantity “small.” We need to know what other quantity with
the dimensions of time we’re comparing it with. The distance that light travels in the
time t is ct = (3 · 108 m/s)(7 · 10−16 s) ≈ 2 · 10−7 m, and this happens to be a perfectly
reasonable fraction of a wavelength of visible light, which is around λ = 6 · 10−7 m, give
or take. So we have ct/λ ≈ 1/3. The time we want to compare 2Lv2/c3 with is therefore
the time it takes light to travel one wavelength, namely λ/c, and these two times turn out
to be roughly the same size. The interference shift of about a third of a cycle was well
within the precision of the Michelson–Morley setup. So if the ether had really existed,
they definitely would have been able to measure the speed of the earth through it.

3. One proposed explanation of the observed null effect was “frame dragging.” Perhaps the
earth drags the ether along with it, thereby yielding the observed zero relative speed. This
frame dragging is quite plausible, because in the platform example above, the platform
drags a thin layer of air along with it. And more mundanely, a car completely drags the
air in its interior along with it. But it turns out that frame dragging is inconsistent with
stellar aberration, which is the following effect.

Depending on the direction of the earth’s instantaneous velocity as it orbits around the
sun, a given star might (depending on its location) appear at slightly different places in
the sky when viewed at two times, say, six months apart. This is due to the fact that your
telescope must be aimed at a slight angle relative to the actual direction to the star, because
as the star’s light travels down the telescope, the telescope moves slightly in the direction
of the earth’s motion. The ratio of the earth’s speed around the sun to the speed of light
is about 10−4, so the effect is small. But it is large enough to be noticeable, and it has

11 Although we’ve presented the Michelson–Morley experiment here for pedagogical purposes, the
consensus among historians is that Einstein actually wasn’t influenced much by the experiment,
except indirectly through Lorentz’s work on electrodynamics. See Holton (1988).

11.2 The postulates

509

indeed been measured. Note that it is the velocity of the telescope that matters here, and
not its position.12

However, if frame dragging were real, then the light from the star would get dragged
along with the earth and would therefore travel down a telescope that was pointed directly
at the star, in disagreement with the observed fact that the telescope must point at the slight
angle mentioned above. Or even worse, the dragging might produce a boundary layer of
turbulence which would blur the stars. The existence of stellar aberration therefore implies
that frame dragging doesn’t occur. ♣

11.2 The postulates

Let’s now start from scratch and see what the theory of Special Relativity is all
about. We’ll take the route that Einstein took and use two postulates as the basis
of the theory. We’ll start with the speed-of-light postulate:

• The speed of light has the same value in any inertial frame.

I don’t claim that this statement is obvious, or even believable. But I do claim
that it’s easy to understand what the statement says (even if you think it’s too silly
to be true). It says the following. Consider a train moving along the ground at
constant velocity. Someone on the train shines a light from one point on the train
to another. Let the speed of the light with respect to the train be c (≈3 · 108m/s).
Then the above postulate says that a person on the ground also sees the light
move at speed c.

This is a rather bizarre statement. It doesn’t hold for everyday objects. If a
baseball is thrown on a train, then the speed of the baseball is different in the
different frames. The observer on the ground must add the velocity of the ball
(with respect to the train) and the velocity of the train (with respect to the ground)
to obtain the velocity of the ball with respect to the ground.13

The truth of the speed-of-light postulate cannot be demonstrated from first
principles. No statement with any physical content in physics (that is, one that
isn’t purely mathematical, such as, “two apples plus two apples gives four
apples”) can be proven. In the end, we must rely on experiment. And indeed,
all the consequences of the speed-of-light postulate have been verified countless

12 This aberration effect is not the same as the parallax effect in which the direction of the actual
position of an object changes, depending on the location of the observer. For example, people at
different locations on the earth see the moon at different angles (that is, they see the moon in line
with different distant stars). Although stellar parallax has been measured for nearby stars (as the
earth goes around the sun), its angular effect is much smaller than the angular effect from stellar
aberration. The former decreases with distance, whereas the latter doesn’t. For further discussion
of aberration, and of why it is only the earth’s velocity (or rather, the change in its velocity) that
matters, and not also the star’s velocity (since you might think, based on the title of this chapter,
that it is the relative velocity that matters), see Eisner (1967).

13 Actually, this isn’t quite true, as the velocity-addition formula in Section 11.5.1 shows. But it’s

true enough for the point we’re making here.

510

Relativity (Kinematics)

times during the past century. As discussed in the previous section, the most
well-known of the early experiments on the speed of light was the one performed
by Michelson and Morley. And in more recent years, the consequences of the pos-
tulate have been verified continually in high-energy particle accelerators, where
elementary particles reach speeds very close to c. The collection of all the data
from numerous experiments over the years allows us to conclude with near cer-
tainty that our starting assumption of an invariant speed of light is correct (or is
at least the limiting case of a more accurate theory).

There is one more postulate in the Special Relativity theory, namely the
“relativity” postulate (also called the Principle of Relativity). It is much more
believable than the speed-of-light postulate, so you might just take it for granted
and forget to consider it. But like any postulate, of course, it is crucial. It can be
stated in various ways, but we’ll simply word it as:

• All inertial frames are “equivalent.”

This postulate basically says that a given inertial frame is no better than any
other. There is no preferred reference frame. That is, it makes no sense to say
that something is moving; it makes sense only to say that one thing is moving
with respect to another. This is where the “Relativity” in Special Relativity comes
from. There is no absolute frame; the motion of any frame is defined only relative
to other frames.

This postulate also says that if the laws of physics hold in one inertial frame
(and presumably they do hold in the frame in which I now sit),14 then they hold
in all others. It also says that if we have two frames S and S(cid:16), then S should see
things in S(cid:16) in exactly the same way as S(cid:16) sees things in S, because we can just
switch the labels of S and S(cid:16) (we’ll get our money’s worth out of this statement
in the next few sections). It also says that empty space is homogeneous (that is,
all points look the same), because we can pick any point to be, say, the origin of a
coordinate system. It also says that empty space is isotropic (that is, all directions
look the same), because we can pick any axis to be, say, the x axis of a coordinate
system.

Unlike the first postulate, this second one is entirely reasonable. We’ve gotten
used to having no special places in the universe. We gave up having the earth as
the center, so let’s not give any other point a chance, either.

The second postulate is nothing more than the familiar principle of Galilean
invariance, assuming that the latter is written in the “The laws of physics hold in
all inertial frames” form, and not in the form that explicitly mentions the Galilean
transformations, which are inconsistent with the speed-of-light postulate.

Everything we’ve said here about the second postulate refers to empty space.
If we have a chunk of mass, then there is certainly a difference between the
position of the mass and a point a meter away. To incorporate mass into the theory,
we would have to delve into General Relativity. But we won’t have anything to
say about that in this chapter. We will deal only with empty space, containing
perhaps a few observant souls sailing along in rockets or floating aimlessly on
little spheres. Though it may sound boring at first, it will turn out to be more
exciting than you’d think.

Remark: Given the second postulate, you might wonder if we even need the first. If all inertial
frames are equivalent, shouldn’t the speed of light be the same in any frame? Well, no. For all
we know, light might behave like a baseball. A baseball certainly doesn’t have the same speed
with respect to different frames, and this doesn’t ruin the equivalence of the frames.

It turns out (see Section 11.10) that nearly all of Special Relativity can be derived by
invoking only the second postulate. The first postulate simply fills in the last bit of necessary
information by stating that something has the same finite speed in every frame. It’s actually
not important that this thing happens to be light. It could be mashed potatoes or something else
(well, it has to be massless, as we’ll see in Chapter 12, so they’d have to be massless potatoes,
but whatever), and the theory would come out the same. So to be a little more minimalistic,
it’s sufficient to state the first postulate as, “There is something that has the same speed in any
inertial frame.” It just so happens that in our universe this thing is what allows us to see.15 ♣

11.3 The fundamental effects

The most striking effects of our two postulates are (1) the loss of simultane-
ity, (2) length contraction, and (3) time dilation. In this section, we’ll discuss
these three effects using some time-honored concrete examples. In the following
section, we’ll derive the Lorentz transformations using these three results.

11.3.1 Loss of simultaneity

Consider the following setup. In A’s reference frame, a light source is placed
midway between two receivers, a distance (cid:2)(cid:16) from each (see Fig. 11.4). The light
source emits a flash. From A’s point of view, the light hits the two receivers at
the same time, (cid:2)(cid:16)/c seconds after the flash. Now consider another observer, B,
who travels to the left at speed v. From her point of view, does the light hit the
receivers at the same time? We will show that it does not.

15 To go a step further, it’s actually not even necessary for there to exist something that has the same
speed in any frame. The theory will still come out the same if we write the first postulate as, “There
is a limiting speed of an object in any frame.” (See Section 11.10 for a discussion of this.) There’s
no need to have something that actually travels at this speed. It’s conceivable to have a theory that
contains no massless objects, so that everything travels slower than this limiting speed.

In B’s reference frame, the situation looks like that in Fig. 11.5. The receivers
(along with everything else in A’s frame) move to the right at speed v, and the
light travels in both directions at speed c with respect to B (not with respect to the
light source, as measured in B’s frame; this is where the speed-of-light postulate
comes into play). Therefore, the relative speed (as viewed by B) of the light and
the left receiver is c + v, and the relative speed of the light and the right receiver
is c − v.

Remark: Yes, it’s legal to just add and subtract these speeds to obtain the relative speeds as
viewed by B. If v equals, say, 2 · 108 m/s, then in one second the left receiver moves 2 · 108 m
to the right, while the left ray of light moves 3 · 108 m to the left. This means that they are now
5 · 108 m closer than they were a second ago. In other words, the relative speed (as measured
by B) is 5 · 108 m/s, which is simply c + v. (Note that this implies that it’s perfectly legal for
the relative speed of two things, as measured by a third, to take any value up to 2c.) Both the v
and c here are measured with respect to the same person, namely B, so our intuition works fine.
We don’t need to use the “velocity-addition formula,” which we’ll derive in Section 11.5.1,
and which is relevant in a different setup. I include this remark here just in case you’ve seen
the velocity-addition formula and think it’s relevant in this setup. But if it didn’t occur to you,
then never mind. ♣

Let (cid:2) be the distance from the source to the receivers, as measured by B.16
Then in B’s frame, the light hits the left receiver at tl and the right receiver at
tr, where

tl =

(cid:2)
c + v ,

and

tr =

(cid:2)
c − v .

(11.5)

These are not equal if v (cid:13)= 0. (The one exception is when (cid:2) = 0, in which case
the two events happen at the same place and same time in all frames.) The moral
of this exercise is that it makes no sense to say that one event happens at the same
time as another, unless you state which frame you’re talking about. Simultaneity
depends on the frame in which the observations are made.

Of the many effects, miscellaneous,
The loss of events, simultaneous,
Allows B to claim
There’s no pause in A’s frame,

Remarks:

1. The invariance of the speed of light was used in saying that the two relative speeds above
were c + v and c − v. If we were talking about baseballs instead of light beams, then the
relative speeds wouldn’t look like this. If vb is the speed at which the baseballs are thrown

16 We’ll see in Section 11.3.3 that (cid:2) is not equal to (cid:2)(cid:16)

, due to length contraction. But this won’t be
important for what we’re doing here. The only fact we need for now is that the light source is
equidistant from the receivers, as measured by B. This is true because space is homogeneous,
which implies that the length-contraction factor must be the same everywhere. More on this in
Section 11.3.3.

11.3 The fundamental effects

513

in A’s frame, then B sees the balls move at speeds vb −v to the left and vb +v to the right.17
These are not equal to vb, as they would be in the case of the light beams. The relative
speeds between the balls and the left and right receivers are therefore (vb − v) + v = vb
and (vb + v) − v = vb. These are equal, so B sees the balls hit the receivers at the same
time, as we know very well from everyday experience.

2. It is indeed legal in Eq. (11.5) to obtain the times by simply dividing (cid:2) by the relative
speeds, c + v and c − v. But if you want a more formal method, then you can use this
reasoning: In B’s frame, the position of the right photon is given by ct, and the position
of the right receiver (which had a head start of (cid:2)) is given by (cid:2) + vt. Equating these two
positions gives tr = (cid:2)/(c − v). Likewise for the left photon.

3. There is always a difference between the time an event happens and the time someone
sees the event happen, because light takes time to travel from the event to the observer.
What we calculated above were the times at which the events really happen. If we wanted
to, we could calculate the times at which B sees the events occur, but such times are rarely
important, and in general we won’t be concerned with them. They can easily be calculated
by adding on a (distance)/c time difference for the path of the photons to B’s eye. Of
course, if B actually did the above experiment to find tr and tl, she would do it by writing
down the times at which she saw the events occur, and then subtracting off the relevant
(distance)/c time differences to find when the events really happened.

To sum up, the tr (cid:13)= tl result in Eq. (11.5) is due to the fact that the events truly occur
at different times in B’s frame. It has nothing to do with the time it takes light to travel to
your eye. In this chapter, we will often use sloppy language and say things like, “What
time does B see event Q happen?” But we don’t really mean, “When do B’s eyes register
that Q happened?” Instead, we mean, “What time does B know that event Q happened in
her frame?” If we ever want to use “see” in the former sense, we will explicitly say so (as
in Section 11.8 on the Doppler effect). ♣

Where this last line is not so extraneous.

Example (Rear clock ahead): Two clocks are positioned at the ends of a train
of length L (as measured in its own frame). They are synchronized in the train frame.
The train travels past you at speed v. It turns out that if you observe the clocks at
simultaneous times in your frame, you will see the rear clock showing a higher reading
than the front clock (see Fig. 11.6). By how much?

Solution: As above, let’s put a light source on the train, but let’s now position it so
that the light hits the clocks at the ends of the train at the same time in your frame. As
above, the relative speeds of the photons and the clocks are c + v and c − v (as viewed
in your frame). We therefore need to divide the train into lengths in this ratio, in your
frame. But since length contraction (discussed in Section 11.3.3) is independent of
position, this must also be the ratio in the train frame. So in the train frame, you
can quickly show that two numbers that are in this ratio, and that add up to L, are
L(c + v)/2c and L(c − v)/2c.

The situation in the train frame therefore looks like that in Fig. 11.7. The light must
travel an extra distance of L(c + v)/2c − L(c − v)/2c = Lv/c to reach the rear clock.
The light travels at speed c (as always), so the extra time is Lv/c2. Therefore, the rear

Relativity (Kinematics)

clock reads Lv/c2 more when it is hit by the backward photon, compared with what
the front clock reads when it is hit by the forward photon.

Now, let the instant you look at the clocks be the instant the photons hit them (that’s
why we chose the hittings to be simultaneous in your frame). Then from the previous
paragraph, you observe the rear clock reading more than the front clock by an amount,

(difference in readings) = Lv

.

(11.6)

Note that the L that appears here is the length of the train in its own frame, and not
the shortened length that you observe in your frame (see Section 11.3.3). Appendix G
gives a number of other derivations of Eq. (11.6), although they rely on material yet
to come in this chapter and Chapter 14.

Remarks:

1. This Lv/c2 result has nothing to do with the fact that the rear clock takes more time

to pass you.

2. The result does not say that you see the rear clock ticking at a faster rate than the front
clock. They run at the same rate (both have the same time-dilation factor relative to
you; see Section 11.3.2). The rear clock is simply a fixed time ahead of the front
clock, as seen by you.

3. The fact that the rear clock is ahead of the front clock in your frame means that in

the train frame the light hits the rear clock after it hits the front clock.

4. It’s easy to forget which of the clocks is the one that is ahead. But a helpful mnemonic
for remembering “rear clock ahead” is that both the first and fourth letters in each
word form the same acronym, “rca,” which is an anagram for “car,” which is sort of
like a train. Sure. ♣

We present here the classic example of a light beam traveling vertically on a train.
Let there be a light source on the floor of the train and a mirror on the ceiling,
which is a height h above the floor. Let observer A be at rest on the train, and
let observer B be at rest on the ground. The speed of the train with respect to
the ground is v.18 A flash of light is emitted. The light travels up to the mirror,
bounces off it, and then heads back down. Assume that after the light is emitted,
we replace the source with a mirror, so that the light keeps bouncing up and down
indefinitely.

In A’s frame, the train is at rest. The path of the light is shown in Fig. 11.8.
It takes the light a time h/c to reach the ceiling and then a time h/c to return to

18 Technically, the words, “with respect to …,” should always be included when talking about speeds,
because there is no absolute reference frame, and hence no absolute speed. But in the future, when
it’s clear what we mean (as in the case of a train moving with respect to the ground), we’ll
occasionally be sloppy and drop the “with respect to …”

In B’s frame, the train moves at speed v. The path of the light is shown in
Fig. 11.9. The crucial fact to remember is that the speed of light in B’s frame
is still c. This means that the light travels along its diagonally upward path at
speed c. (The vertical component of the speed is not c, as would be the case if light
behaved like a baseball.) Since the horizontal component of the light’s velocity
√
is v,19 the vertical component must be
c2 − v2, as shown in Fig. 11.10.20 The
time it takes to reach the mirror is therefore h/

Dividing Eq. (11.8) by Eq. (11.7) gives

where

tB = γ tA,

γ ≡

1(cid:4)

1 − v2/c2

.

This γ factor is ubiquitous in Special Relativity. Note that it is always greater
than or equal to 1. This means that the roundtrip time is longer in B’s frame than
in A’s frame.

What are the implications of this? For concreteness, let v/c = 3/5, so γ =
5/4. Then we may say the following. If A is standing next to the light source, and
if B is standing on the ground, and if A claps his hands at tA = 4 second intervals,
then B observes claps at tB = 5 second intervals (after having subtracted off the
time for the light to travel to her eye, of course). This is true because both A and
B must agree on the number of roundtrips the light beam takes between claps.
If we assume, for convenience, that a roundtrip takes one second in A’s frame
(yes, that would be a tall train), then the four roundtrips between claps take five
seconds in B’s frame, using Eq. (11.9).

Remark: We just made the claim that both A and B must agree on the number of roundtrips
between claps. However, since A and B disagree on so many things (whether two events are

19 Yes, it’s still v. The light is always located on the vertical line between the source and the mirror.

Since both of these objects move horizontally at speed v, the light does also.

20 The Pythagorean theorem is indeed valid here. It’s valid for distances, and since speeds are just

distances divided by time, it’s valid also for speeds.

21 We’ve assumed that the height of the train in B’s frame is still h. Although we’ll see in Section
11.3.3 that there is length contraction along the direction of motion, there is none in the direction
perpendicular to the motion (see Problem 11.1).

516

Relativity (Kinematics)

simultaneous, the rate at which clocks tick, and the length of things, as we’ll see below), you
might be wondering if there’s anything they agree on. Yes, there are still frame-independent
statements we can hang on to. If a bucket of paint flies past you and dumps paint on your
head, then everyone agrees that you are covered in paint. Likewise, if A is standing next to the
light clock and claps when the light reaches the floor, then everyone agrees on this. If the light
is actually a strong laser pulse, and if A’s clapping motion happens to bring his hands right
over the mirror when the pulse gets there, then everyone agrees that his hands get burned by
the laser. ♣

What if we have a train that doesn’t contain one of our special light clocks? It
doesn’t matter. We could have built one if we wanted to, so the same results con-
cerning the claps must hold. Therefore, light clock or no light clock, B observes
A moving strangely slowly. From B’s point of view, A’s heart beats slowly, his
blinks are lethargic, and his sips of coffee are slow enough to suggest that he
needs another cup.

The effects of dilation of time
Are magical, strange, and sublime.
In your frame, this verse,
Which you’ll see is not terse,
Can be read in the same amount of time it takes someone
else in another frame to read a similar sort of rhyme.

Our assumption that A is at rest on the train was critical in the above derivation.
If A is moving with respect to the train, then Eq. (11.9) doesn’t hold, because
we cannot say that both A and B must agree on the number of roundtrips the
light beam takes between claps, because of the problem with simultaneity. More
precisely, if A is at rest on the train right next to the light source, then there are
no issues with simultaneity, because the distance L in Eq. (11.6) is zero. And if
A is at rest at a fixed distance from the source, then consider a person A(cid:16) at rest
on the train right next to the source. The distance L between A and A(cid:16) is nonzero,
so from the loss of simultaneity, B sees their two clocks read different times. But
this difference is constant, so B sees A’s clock tick at the same rate as A(cid:16)’s clock.
Equivalently, we can just build a second light clock in a little box and have A
hold it, and it will have the same speed v (and thus yield the same γ factor) as
the first clock.

However, if A is moving with respect to the train, then we have a problem.
If A(cid:16) is again at rest next to the source, then the distance L between A and A(cid:16)
is changing, so B can’t use the reasoning in the previous paragraph to conclude
that A’s and A(cid:16)’s clocks tick at the same rate. And in fact they do not, because as
above, we can build another light clock and have A hold it. In this case, A’s speed
is what goes into the γ factor in Eq. (11.10), but this is different from A(cid:16)’s speed
(which is the speed of the train).

Remarks:

1. The time dilation result derived in Eq. (11.9) is a bit strange, no doubt, but there doesn’t
seem to be anything downright incorrect about it until we look at the situation from A’s

11.3 The fundamental effects

517

point of view. A sees B flying by at a speed v in the other direction. The ground is no
more fundamental than a train, so the same reasoning applies. The time dilation factor, γ ,
doesn’t depend on the sign of v, so A sees the same time dilation factor that B sees. That
is, A sees B’s clock running slow. But how can this be? Are we claiming that A’s clock is
slower than B’s, and also that B’s clock is slower than A’s? Well . . . yes and no.

Remember that the above time-dilation reasoning applies only to a situation where
something is motionless in the appropriate frame. In the second situation (where A sees B
flying by), the statement tA = γ tB holds only when the two events (say, two ticks on B’s
clock) happen at the same place in B’s frame. But for two such events, they are certainly
not in the same place in A’s frame, so the tB = γ tA result in Eq. (11.9) does not hold. The
conditions of being motionless in each frame never both hold for a given setup (unless
v = 0, in which case γ = 1 and tA = tB). So, the answer to the question at the end of the
previous paragraph is “yes” if you ask the questions in the appropriate frames, and “no”
if you think the answer should be frame independent.

2. Concerning the fact that A sees B’s clock run slow, and B sees A’s clock run slow, consider
the following statement. “This is a contradiction. It is essentially the same as saying, ‘I
have two apples on a table. The left one is bigger than the right one, and the right one is
bigger than the left one.’ ” How would you respond to this? Well, it is not a contradiction.
Observers A and B are using different coordinates to measure time. The times measured in
each of their frames are quite different things. The seemingly contradictory time-dilation
result is really no stranger than having two people run away from each other into the
distance, and having them both say that the other person looks smaller. In short, we are
not comparing apples and apples. We are comparing apples and oranges. A more correct
analogy would be the following. An apple and an orange sit on a table. The apple says to
the orange, “You are a much uglier apple than I am,” and the orange says to the apple,
“You are a much uglier orange than I am.”

3. One might view the statement, “A sees B’s clock running slow, and also B sees A’s clock
running slow,” as somewhat unsettling. But in fact it would be a complete disaster for
the theory if A and B viewed each other in different ways. A critical fact in the theory of
relativity is that A sees B in exactly the same way as B sees A.

4. In everything we’ve done so far, we’ve assumed that A and B are in inertial frames,
because these are the frames that the postulates of Special Relativity deal with. However,
it turns out that the time dilation result in Eq. (11.9) holds even if A is accelerating, as long
as B isn’t. In other words, if you’re looking at a clock that is undergoing a complicated
accelerating motion, then to figure out how fast it’s ticking in your frame, all you need to
know is its speed at any instant; its acceleration is irrelevant (this has plenty of experimental
verification). If, however, you are accelerating, then all bets are off, and it’s not valid for
you to use the time dilation result when looking at a clock. It’s still possible to get a handle
on such situations, but we’ll wait until Chapter 14 to do so. ♣

Example (Twin paradox): Twin A stays on the earth, while twin B flies quickly
to a distant star and back (see Fig. 11.11). Show that B is younger than A when they
meet up again.

Solution: From A’s point of view, B’s clock is running slow by a factor γ , on
both the outward and return parts of the trip. Therefore, B is younger than A when
they meet up again. This is the answer, and that’s that. So if getting the right answer
is all we care about, then we can pack up and go home. But our reasoning leaves
one large point unaddressed. The “paradox” part of this example’s title comes from
the following alternate reasoning. Someone might say that in B’s frame, A’s clock is
running slow by a factor γ , and so A is younger than B when they meet up again.

Relativity (Kinematics)

It’s definitely true that when the two twins are standing next to each other (that
is, when they are in the same frame), we can’t have both B younger than A, and
A younger than B. So what is wrong with the reasoning at the end of the previous
paragraph? The error lies in the fact that there is no “one frame” that B is in. The
inertial frame for the outward trip is different from the inertial frame for the return
trip. The derivation of our time-dilation result applies only to one inertial frame.

Said in a different way, B accelerates when she turns around, and our time-dilation
result holds only from the point of view of an inertial observer.22 The symmetry in the
problem is broken by the acceleration. If both A and B are blindfolded, they can still
tell who is doing the traveling, because B will feel the acceleration at the turnaround.
Constant velocity cannot be felt, but acceleration can be. (However, see Chapter 14
on General Relativity. Gravity complicates things.)

The above paragraphs show what is wrong with the “A is younger” reasoning, but
they don’t show how to modify it quantitatively to obtain the correct answer. There are
many different ways of doing this, and you can tackle some of them in the problems
(Exercise 11.67, Problems 11.2, 11.19, 11.24, and various problems in Chapter 14).
Also, Appendix H gives a list of all the possible resolutions to the twin paradox that
I can think of.

Example (Muon decay): Elementary particles called muons (which are identical
to electrons, except that they are about 200 times as massive) are created in the upper
atmosphere when cosmic rays collide with air molecules. The muons have an average
−6 seconds23 (then they decay into electrons and neutrinos),
lifetime of about 2 · 10
and move at nearly the speed of light. Assume for simplicity that a certain muon is
created at a height of 50 km, moves straight downward, has a speed v = 0.99998 c,
−6 seconds, and doesn’t collide with anything on the
decays in exactly T = 2 · 10
way down.24 Will the muon reach the earth before it (the muon!) decays?

Solution: The naive thing to say is that the distance traveled by the muon is
−6 s) = 600 m, and that this is less than 50 km,
d = vT ≈ (3 · 108 m/s)(2 · 10
so the muon doesn’t reach the earth. This reasoning is incorrect, because of the time-
dilation effect. The muon lives longer in the earth frame, by a factor of γ , which is
γ = 1/
1 − v2/c2 ≈ 160 here. The correct distance traveled in the earth frame is
therefore v(γ T ) ≈ 100 km. Hence, the muon travels the 50 km, with room to spare.
The real-life fact that we actually do detect muons reaching the surface of the earth
in the predicted abundances (while the naive d = vT reasoning would predict that

(cid:4)

22 For the entire outward and return parts of the trip, B does observe A’s clock running slow, but
enough strangeness occurs during the turning-around period to make A end up older. Note, how-
ever, that a discussion of acceleration is not required to quantitatively understand the paradox, as
Problem 11.2 shows.

23 This is the “proper” lifetime, that is, the lifetime as measured in the frame of the muon.
24 In the real world, the muons are created at various heights, move in different directions, have
different speeds, decay in lifetimes that vary according to a standard half-life formula, and may
very well bump into air molecules. So technically we’ve got everything wrong here. But that’s no
matter. This example will work just fine for the present purpose.

theory.

11.3.3 Length contraction

Consider the following setup. Person A stands on a train which he measures to
have length (cid:2)(cid:16), and person B stands on the ground. The train moves at speed v
with respect to the ground. A light source is located at the back of the train, and
a mirror is located at the front. The source emits a flash of light that heads to the
mirror, bounces off, then heads back to the source. By looking at how long this
process takes in the two reference frames, we can determine the length of the
train as measured by B.25 In A’s frame (see Fig. 11.12), the roundtrip time for
the light is simply

equal (cid:2)(cid:16), but we’ll soon find that it does not. The relative speed (as measured
by B) of the light and the mirror during the first part of the trip is c − v. The
relative speed during the second part is c + v. During each part, the light must
close a gap with initial length (cid:2). Therefore, the total roundtrip time is

This is a valid statement, because the two events we are concerned with (light
leaving back, and light returning to back) happen at the same place in the train
frame, so it’s legal to use the time-dilation result in Eq. (11.9). Substituting the
results for tA and tB from Eqs. (11.11) and (11.12) into Eq. (11.13), we find

(cid:2) =

(cid:2)(cid:16)
γ .

(11.14)

Note that we could not have used this setup to find the length contraction if we
had not already found the time dilation in Eq. (11.9).

25 The third remark below gives another (quicker) derivation of length contraction. But we’ll go

through the present derivation because the calculation is instructive.

Since γ ≥ 1, we see that B measures the train to be shorter than A measures.
The term proper length is used to describe the length of an object in its rest frame.
So (cid:2)(cid:16) is the proper length of the above train, and the length in any other frame is less
than or equal to (cid:2)(cid:16). This length contraction is often called the Lorentz–FitzGerald
contraction, for the reason given in Footnote 10.

Remarks:

1. The length-contraction result in Eq. (11.14) is for lengths along the direction of the rel-
ative velocity. There is no length contraction in the perpendicular direction, as shown in
Problem 11.1.

2. As with time dilation, this length contraction is a bit strange, but there doesn’t seem
to be anything actually paradoxical about it, until we look at things from A’s point of
view. To make a nice symmetrical situation, let’s say B is standing on an identical train,
which is motionless with respect to the ground. A sees B flying by at speed v in the other
direction. Neither train is any more fundamental than the other, so the same reasoning
applies, and A sees the same length contraction factor that B sees. That is, A measures
B’s train to be short. But how can this be? Are we claiming that A’s train is shorter
than B’s, and also that B’s train is shorter than A’s? Is the actual setup the one shown in
Fig. 11.14, or is it the one shown in Fig. 11.15? Which does it really look like? Well … it
depends.

The word “is” in the above paragraph is a very bad word to use and is generally the
cause of all the confusion (but it is ok in this paragraph, thankfully). There is no such
thing as “is-ness” when it comes to lengths. It makes no sense to say what the length of
the train really is. It makes sense only to say what the length is in a given frame. The
situation doesn’t really look like one thing in particular. The look depends on the frame
in which the looking is being done.

Let’s be a little more specific. How do you measure a length? You write down the
coordinates of the ends of something measured simultaneously, and then you take the
difference. But the word “simultaneous” here should send up all sorts of red flags.
Simultaneous events in one frame are not simultaneous events in another. Stated more
precisely, here is what we are claiming: Let B write down simultaneous coordinates
of the ends of A’s train, and also simultaneous coordinates of the ends of her own
train. Then the difference between the former is smaller than the difference between
the latter. Likewise, let A write down simultaneous coordinates of the ends of B’s train,
and also simultaneous coordinates of the ends of his own train. Then the difference
between the former is smaller than the difference between the latter. There is no contra-
diction here, because the times at which A and B are writing down the coordinates don’t
have much to do with each other, due to the loss of simultaneity. You can be quanti-
tative about this in Problem 11.3. As with time dilation, we are comparing apples and
oranges.

3. There is an easy argument to show that time dilation implies length contraction, and vice
versa. Let B stand on the ground, next to a stick of length (cid:2). Let A fly past the stick at
speed v. In B’s frame, it takes A a time of (cid:2)/v to traverse the length of the stick. Therefore
(assuming that we have demonstrated the time-dilation result), a watch on A’s wrist will
advance by a time of only (cid:2)/γ v while he traverses the length of the stick.

11.3 The fundamental effects

521

How does A view the situation? He sees the ground and the stick fly by at speed v.
The time between the two ends passing him is (cid:2)/γ v (because that is the time elapsed
on his watch). To get the length of the stick in his frame, he simply multiplies the
speed by the time. That is, he measures the length to be ((cid:2)/γ v)v = (cid:2)/γ , which is
the desired contraction. The same argument also shows that length contraction implies
time dilation.

4. As mentioned earlier, the length contraction factor γ is independent of position on the
object. That is, all parts of the train are contracted by the same amount. This follows
from the fact that all points in space are equivalent. Equivalently, we could put a large
number of small replicas of the above source–mirror system along the length of the
train. They would all produce the same value for γ , independent of the position on
the train.

5. If you still want to ask, “Is the contraction really real?” then consider the following
hypothetical undertaking. Imagine a sheet of paper moving sideways past the Mona Lisa,
skimming the surface. A standard sheet of paper is plenty large enough to cover her face,
so if the paper is moving slowly, and if you take a photograph at the appropriate time,
then in the photo you’ll see her entire face covered by the paper. However, if the sheet
is flying by sufficiently fast, and if you take a photograph at the appropriate time, then
in the photo you’ll see a thin vertical strip of paper covering only a small fraction of her
face. So you’ll still see her smiling at you. ♣

Example (Passing trains): Two trains, A and B, each have proper length L and
move in the same direction. A’s speed is 4c/5, and B’s speed is 3c/5. A starts behind
B (see Fig. 11.16). How long, as viewed by person C on the ground, does it take for
A to overtake B? By this we mean the time between the front of A passing the back
of B, and the back of A passing the front of B.

Solution: Relative to C on the ground, the γ factors associated with A and B are
5/3 and 5/4, respectively. Therefore, their lengths in the ground frame are 3L/5 and
4L/5. While overtaking B, A must travel farther than B, by an excess distance equal
to the sum of the lengths of the trains, which is 7L/5. The relative speed of the two
trains (as viewed by C on the ground) is the difference of the speeds, which is c/5.
The total time is therefore

tC = 7L/5
c/5

= 7L
c

.

(11.15)

Example (Muon decay, again): Consider the “Muon decay” example from
−6
Section 11.3.2. From the muon’s point of view, it lives for a time of T = 2 · 10
seconds, and the earth is speeding toward it at v = 0.99998c. How, then, does
the earth (which travels only d = vT ≈ 600 m before the muon decays) reach the
muon?

Solution: The important point here is that in the muon’s frame, the distance to the
earth is contracted by a factor γ ≈ 160. Therefore, the earth starts only 50 km/160 ≈
300 m away. Since the earth can travel a distance of 600 m during the muon’s lifetime,
the earth collides with the muon, with time to spare.

As stated in the third remark above, time dilation and length contraction are inti-
mately related. We can’t have one without the other. In the earth’s frame, the muon’s

arrival on the earth is explained by time dilation. In the muon’s frame, it is explained
by length contraction.

Observe that for muons created,

In the frame where decays aren’t belated.

An extremely important strategy in solving relativity problems is to plant
yourself in a frame and stay there. The only thoughts running through your head
should be what you observe. That is, don’t try to use reasoning along the lines
of, “Well, the person I’m looking at in this other frame sees such-and-such.”
This will almost certainly cause an error somewhere along the way, because you
will inevitably end up writing down an equation that combines quantities that
are measured in different frames, which is a no-no. Of course, you might want
to solve another part of the problem by working in another frame, or you might
want to redo the whole problem in another frame. That’s fine, but once you decide
which frame you’re going to use, make sure you put yourself there and stay there.
Another very important strategy is to draw a picture of the setup (in whatever
frame you’ve chosen) at every moment when something significant happens, as
we did in Fig. 11.13. Once we drew the pictures there, it was clear what we
needed to do. But without the pictures, we almost certainly would have gotten
confused.

At this point you might want to look at the “Qualitative relativity questions” in
Appendix F, just to make sure we’re all on the same page. Some of the questions
deal with material we haven’t covered yet, but most are relevant to what we’ve
done so far.

This concludes our treatment of the three fundamental effects. In the next
section, we’ll combine all the information we’ve gained and use it to derive the
Lorentz transformations. But one last comment before we get to those:

Lattice of clocks and meter sticks
In everything we’ve done so far, we’ve taken the route of having observers sitting
in various frames, making various measurements. But as mentioned earlier, this
can cause some ambiguity, because you might think that the time when light
reaches the observer is important, whereas what we are generally concerned with
is the time when something actually happens.

A way to avoid this ambiguity is to remove the observers and then imag-
ine filling up space with a large rigid lattice of meter sticks and synchronized

11.4 The Lorentz transformations

523

clocks. Different frames are defined by different lattices; assume that the lattices
of different frames can somehow pass freely through each other. All the meter
sticks in a given frame are at rest with respect to all the others, so we don’t have
to worry about issues of length contraction within each frame. But the lattice of
a frame moving past you is squashed in the direction of motion, because all the
meter sticks in that direction are contracted.

To measure the length of an object in a given frame, we just need to determine
where the ends are (at simultaneous times, as measured in that frame) with respect
to the lattice. As far as the synchronization of the clocks within each frame
goes, this can be accomplished by putting a light source midway between any
two clocks and sending out signals, and then setting the clocks to a certain
value when the signals hit them. Alternatively, a more straightforward method
of synchronization is to start with all the clocks synchronized right next to each
other, and then move them very slowly to their final positions. Any time-dilation
effects can be made arbitrarily small by moving the clocks sufficiently slowly.
This is true because the time-dilation γ factor is second order in v, but the time
it takes a clock to reach its final position is only first order in 1/v.

This lattice way of looking at things emphasizes that observers are not impor-
tant, and that a frame is defined simply as a lattice of space and time coordinates.
Anything that happens (an “event”) is automatically assigned a space and time
coordinate in every frame, independent of any observer. The concept of an “event”
will be very important in the next section.

11.4 The Lorentz transformations

11.4.1 The derivation
Consider a coordinate system, S(cid:16), moving relative to another system, S (see
Fig. 11.17). Let the constant relative speed of the frames be v. Let the corre-
sponding axes of S and S(cid:16) point in the same direction, and let the origin of S(cid:16)
move along the x axis of S, in the positive direction. Nothing exciting happens
in the y and z directions (see Problem 11.1), so we’ll ignore them.

Our goal in this section is to look at two events (an event is anything that
has space and time coordinates) in spacetime and relate the (cid:16)x and (cid:16)t of the
coordinates in one frame to the (cid:16)x(cid:16) and (cid:16)t(cid:16) of the coordinates in another. We
therefore want to find the constants A, B, C, and D in the relations,

(cid:16)x = A (cid:16)x
(cid:16)t = C (cid:16)t

(cid:16)

(cid:16) + B (cid:16)t
(cid:16) + D (cid:16)x

,
(cid:16)

.

(11.16)

The four constants here will end up depending on v (which is constant, given the
two inertial frames). But we won’t explicitly write this dependence, for ease of
notation.

Relativity (Kinematics)

Remarks:

1. We have assumed in Eq. (11.16) that (cid:16)x and (cid:16)t are linear functions of (cid:16)x(cid:16) and (cid:16)t(cid:16). And
we have also assumed that A, B, C, and D are constants, that is, they depend at most on
v, and not on x, t, x(cid:16), t(cid:16).

The first of these assumptions is justified by the fact that any finite interval can be built
up from a series of many infinitesimal ones. But for an infinitesimal interval, any terms
such as ((cid:16)t(cid:16))2, for example, are negligible compared with the linear terms. Therefore, if
we add up all the infinitesimal intervals to obtain a finite one, we will be left with only
the linear terms. Equivalently, it shouldn’t matter whether we make a measurement with,
say, meter sticks or half-meter sticks.

The second assumption can be justified in various ways. One is that all inertial frames
should agree on what “nonaccelerating” motion is. That is, if (cid:16)x(cid:16) = u(cid:16) (cid:16)t(cid:16), then we should
also have (cid:16)x = u (cid:16)t, for some constant u. This is true only if the above coefficients
are constants, as you can check. Another justification comes from the second of our two
relativity postulates, which says that all points in (empty) space are indistinguishable. With
this in mind, let’s assume that we have a transformation of the form, say, (cid:16)x = A (cid:16)x(cid:16) +
B (cid:16)t(cid:16) + Ex(cid:16) (cid:16)x(cid:16). The x(cid:16) in the last term implies that the absolute location in spacetime
(and not just the relative position) is important. Therefore, this last term cannot exist.
2. If the relations in Eq. (11.16) turned out to be the usual Galilean transformations (which are
the ones that hold for everyday relative speeds v) then we would have (cid:16)x = (cid:16)x(cid:16) + v (cid:16)t,
and (cid:16)t = (cid:16)t(cid:16) (that is, A = C = 1, B = v, and D = 0). We will find, however, that under
the assumptions of Special Relativity, this is not the case. The Galilean transformations
are not the correct transformations. But we will show below that the correct transforma-
tions do indeed reduce to the Galilean transformations in the limit of slow speeds, as they
must. ♣

The constants A, B, C, and D in Eq. (11.16) are four unknowns, and we can
solve for them by using four facts we found above in Section 11.3. The four facts
we will use are:

Effect

1 Time dilation
2 Length contraction
3 Relative v of frames
4 Rear clock ahead

x(cid:16) = 0
t(cid:16) = 0
x = 0
t = 0

t = γ t(cid:16)
x(cid:16) = x/γ
x(cid:16) = −vt(cid:16)
t(cid:16) = −vx(cid:16)/c2

(11.9)
(11.14)

(11.6)

We have taken the liberty of dropping the (cid:16)’s in front of the coordinates, lest
things get too messy. We will often omit the (cid:16)’s, but it should be understood that
x really means (cid:16)x, etc. We are always concerned with the difference between
coordinates of two events in spacetime. The actual value of any coordinate is
irrelevant, because there is no preferred origin in any frame.

You should pause for a moment and verify that the four “results” in the above
table are in fact the proper mathematical expressions for the four effects, given
the stated “conditions.”26 My advice is to keep pausing until you’re comfortable

26 We can state the effects in other ways too, by switching the primes and unprimes. For example,
(cid:16) = γ t when x = 0.” But we’ve chosen the above ways of writing

time dilation can be written as “t
things because they will allow us to solve for the four unknowns in the most efficient way.

11.4 The Lorentz transformations

with all the entries in the table. Note that the sign in the “rear clock ahead” effect
is indeed correct, because the front clock shows less time than the rear clock. So
the clock with the higher x(cid:16) value is the one with the lower t(cid:16) value.

We can now use our four facts in the above table to quickly solve for the

unknowns A, B, C, and D in Eq. (11.16).

Fact (1) gives C = γ .
Fact (2) gives A = γ .
Fact (3) gives B/A = v =⇒ B = γ v.
Fact (4) gives D/C = v/c2 =⇒ D = γ v/c2.

Equations (11.16), which are known as the Lorentz transformations, are therefore
given by

(cid:16) + v (cid:16)t
(cid:16) + v (cid:16)x

(cid:16)),

(cid:16)x = γ ((cid:16)x

where

(11.17)

(11.18)

We have tacked on the trivial transformations for y and z, but we won’t bother
writing these in the future. Also, we’ll drop the (cid:16)’s from now on, but remember
that they’re always really there.

If we solve for x(cid:16) and t(cid:16) in terms of x and t in Eq. (11.17), then we see that the

inverse Lorentz transformations are given by

(cid:16) = γ (x − vt),
(cid:16) = γ (t − vx/c2).

x

(11.19)

Of course, which ones you label as the “inverse” transformations depends on
your point of view. But it’s intuitively clear that the only difference between the
two sets of equations is the sign of v, because S is simply moving backward with
respect to S(cid:16).

The reason why the derivation of Eqs. (11.17) was so quick is that we
already did most of the work in Section 11.3 when we derived the fundamental
effects. If we wanted to derive the Lorentz transformations from scratch, that is,
by starting with the two postulates in Section 11.2, then the derivation would be
longer. In Appendix I we give such a derivation, where it is clear what infor-
mation comes from each of the postulates. The procedure there is somewhat
cumbersome, but it’s worth taking a look at, because we will invoke the result in
a very cool way in Section 11.10.

526

Relativity (Kinematics)

Remarks:

1. In the limit v (cid:4) c (or more precisely, in the limit vx(cid:16)/c2 (cid:4) t(cid:16), which means that even if v
is small, we have to be careful that x(cid:16) isn’t too large), Eqs. (11.17) reduce to x = x(cid:16) +vt and
t = t(cid:16), which are the good old Galilean transformations. This must be the case, because we
know from everyday experience (where v (cid:4) c) that the Galilean transformations work
just fine.

2. Equations (11.17) exhibit a nice symmetry between x and ct. With β ≡ v/c, we have

(11.20)

Equivalently, in units where c = 1 (for example, where one unit of distance equals 3 · 108
meters, or where one unit of time equals 1/(3 · 108) seconds), Eqs. (11.17) take the
symmetric form,

x = γ (x
t = γ (t

(cid:16) + vx

(11.22)

This looks similar to a rotation matrix. More about this in Section 11.9, and in
Problem 11.27.

4. We did the above derivation in terms of a primed and an unprimed system. But when
you’re doing problems, it’s usually best to label your coordinates with subscripts such
as A for Alice, or T for train. In addition to being more informative, this notation is less
likely to make you think that one frame is more fundamental than the other.

5. It’s easy to get confused about the sign on the right-hand side of the Lorentz transforma-
tions. To figure out if it should be a plus or a minus, write down xA = γ (xB ± vtB), and
then imagine sitting in system A and looking at a fixed point in B. This fixed point satisfies
(putting the (cid:16)’s back in to avoid any mixup) (cid:16)xB = 0, which gives (cid:16)xA = ±γ v(cid:16)tB.
So if the point moves to the right (that is, if it increases as time increases), then pick the
“+.” And if it moves to the left, then pick the “−.” In other words, the sign is determined
by which way A (the person associated with the coordinates on the left-hand side of the
equation) sees B (ditto for the right-hand side) moving.

6. One very important thing we must check is that two successive Lorentz transformations
(from S1 to S2 and then from S2 to S3) again yield a Lorentz transformation (from S1
to S3). This must be true because we showed that any two frames must be related by
Eqs. (11.17). If we composed two L.T.’s (along the same direction) and found that the
transformation from S1 to S3 was not of the form of Eqs. (11.17), for some new v, then the
whole theory would be inconsistent, and we would have to drop one of our postulates.27
You can show that the combination of an L.T. (with speed v1) and an L.T. (with speed v2)
does indeed yield an L.T., and it has speed (v1 + v2)/(1 + v1v2/c2). This is the task of
Exercise 11.47, and also Problem 11.27 (which is stated in terms of rapidity, introduced

27 This statement is true only for the composition of two L.T.’s in the same direction. If we composed
an L.T. in the x direction with one in the y direction, the result would interestingly not be an L.T.
along some new direction, but rather the composition of an L.T. along some direction and a
rotation through some angle. This rotation results in what is known as the Thomas precession.
See the appendix of Muller (1992) for a quick derivation of the Thomas precession. For further
discussion, see Costella et al. (2001) and Rebilas (2002).

11.4 The Lorentz transformations

in Section 11.9). This resulting speed is one that we’ll see again when we get to the
velocity-addition formula in Section 11.5.1. ♣

Example: A train with proper length L moves at speed 5c/13 with respect to the
ground. A ball is thrown from the back of the train to the front. The speed of the ball
with respect to the train is c/3. As viewed by someone on the ground, how much time
does the ball spend in the air, and how far does it travel?

Solution: The γ factor associated with the speed 5c/13 is γ = 13/12. The two
events we are concerned with are “ball leaving back of train” and “ball arriving at front
of train.” The spacetime separation between these events is easy to calculate on the
train. We have (cid:16)xT = L, and (cid:16)tT = L/(c/3) = 3L/c. The Lorentz transformations
giving the coordinates on the ground are therefore

.

In a given problem, such as the above example, one of the frames usually
allows for a quick calculation of (cid:16)x and (cid:16)t, so you simply have to mechanically
plug these quantities into the L.T.’s to obtain (cid:16)x(cid:16) and (cid:16)t(cid:16) in the other frame,
where they may not be as obvious.

Relativity is a subject in which there are usually many ways to do a problem. If
you’re trying to find some (cid:16)x’s and (cid:16)t’s, then you can use the L.T.’s, or perhaps
the invariant interval (introduced in Section 11.6), or maybe a velocity-addition
approach (introduced in Section 11.5.1), or even the sending-of-light-signals
strategy used in Section 11.3. Depending on the specific problem and what your
personal preferences are, certain approaches will be more enjoyable than others.
But no matter which method you choose, you should take advantage of the
plethora of possibilities by picking a second method to double-check your answer.
Personally, I find the L.T.’s to be the perfect option for this, because the other
methods are generally more fun when solving a problem for the first time, while
the L.T.’s are usually quick and easy to apply (perfect for a double-check).28

The excitement will build in your voice,
As you rise from your seat and rejoice,
“A Lorentz transformation
Provides information,
As an alternate method of choice!”

28 I would, however, be very wary of solving a problem using only the L.T.’s, with no other check,
because it’s very easy to mess up a sign in the transformations. And since there’s nothing to do
except mechanically plug in numbers, there’s not much opportunity for an intuitive check, either.

11.4.2 The fundamental effects

Let’s now see how the Lorentz transformations imply the three fundamental
effects (namely, loss of simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction) dis-
cussed in Section 11.3. Of course, we just used these effects to derive the L.T.’s,
so we know everything will work out. We’ll just be going in circles. But since
these fundamental effects are, well, fundamental, let’s belabor the point and
discuss them one more time, with the starting point being the L.T.’s.

Loss of simultaneity
Let two events occur simultaneously in frame S(cid:16). Then the separation between
them, as measured by S(cid:16), is (x(cid:16), t(cid:16)) = (x(cid:16), 0). As usual, we are not bothering to
write the (cid:16)’s in front of the coordinates. Using the second of Eqs. (11.17), we see
that the time between the events, as measured by S, is t = γ vx(cid:16)/c2. This is not
equal to zero (unless x(cid:16) = 0). Therefore, the events do not occur simultaneously
in frame S.

Time dilation
Consider two events that occur in the same place in S(cid:16). Then the separation
between them is (x(cid:16), t(cid:16)) = (0, t(cid:16)). Using the second of Eqs. (11.17), we see that
the time between the events, as measured by S, is

t = γ t

(cid:16)

(if x(cid:16) = 0).

(11.24)

The factor γ is greater than or equal to 1, so t ≥ t(cid:16). The passing of one second on
S(cid:16)’s clock takes more than one second on S’s clock. S sees S(cid:16) drinking his coffee
very slowly.

The same strategy works if we interchange S and S(cid:16). Consider two events
that occur in the same place in S. The separation between them is (x, t) = (0, t).
Using the second of Eqs. (11.19), we see that the time between the events, as
measured by S(cid:16), is

(cid:16) = γ t

t

(if x = 0).

(11.25)

Therefore, t(cid:16) ≥ t. Another way to derive this is to use the first of Eqs. (11.17) to
write x(cid:16) = −vt(cid:16), and then substitute this into the second equation.

If we write down the two above equations by themselves, t = γ t(cid:16) and t(cid:16) = γ t, they
Remark:
appear to contradict each other. This apparent contradiction arises from the omission of the
conditions they are based on. The former equation is based on the assumption that x(cid:16) = 0. The
latter equation is based on the assumption that x = 0. They have nothing to do with each other.
It would perhaps be better to write the equations as

(t = γ t

(cid:16))x(cid:16)=0,

and

(t

(cid:16) = γ t)x=0,

(11.26)

but this is somewhat cumbersome. ♣

11.5 Velocity addition

Length contraction
This proceeds just like the time dilation above, except that now we want to set
certain time intervals equal to zero, instead of certain space intervals. We want
to do this because to measure a length, we calculate the distance between two
points whose positions are measured simultaneously. That’s what a length is.

Consider a stick at rest in S(cid:16), where it has length (cid:2)(cid:16). We want to find the length (cid:2)
in S. Simultaneous measurements of the coordinates of the ends of the stick in S
yield a separation of (x, t) = (x, 0). Using the first of Eqs. (11.19), we have

(cid:16) = γ x

x

(if t = 0).

(11.27)

But x is by definition the length in S. And x(cid:16) is the length in S(cid:16), because the stick
isn’t moving in S(cid:16).29 Therefore, (cid:2) = (cid:2)(cid:16)/γ . And since γ ≥ 1, we have (cid:2) ≤ (cid:2)(cid:16),
so S sees the stick shorter than S(cid:16) sees it.

Now interchange S and S(cid:16). Consider a stick at rest in S, where it has length (cid:2).
We want to find the length in S(cid:16). Measurements of the coordinates of the ends of
the stick in S(cid:16) yield a separation of (x(cid:16), t(cid:16)) = (x(cid:16), 0). Using the first of Eqs. (11.17),
we have

x = γ x

(cid:16)

(if t(cid:16) = 0).

(11.28)

But x(cid:16) is by definition the length in S(cid:16). And x is the length in S, because the stick
is not moving in S. Therefore, (cid:2)(cid:16) = (cid:2)/γ , so (cid:2)(cid:16) ≤ (cid:2).

Remark: As with time dilation, if we write down the two equations by themselves, (cid:2) = (cid:2)(cid:16)/γ
and (cid:2)(cid:16) = (cid:2)/γ , they appear to contradict each other. But as before, this apparent contradiction
arises from the omission of the conditions they are based on. The former equation is based on
the assumptions that t = 0 and that the stick is at rest in S(cid:16). The latter equation is based on the
assumptions that t(cid:16) = 0 and that the stick is at rest in S. They have nothing to do with each
other. We should really write,

(x = x

(cid:16)/γ )t=0,

and

(x

(cid:16) = x/γ )t(cid:16)=0,

(11.29)

and then identify x(cid:16) in the first equation with (cid:2)(cid:16) only after invoking the further assumption that
the stick is at rest in S(cid:16). Likewise for the second equation. But this is a pain. ♣

Consider the following setup. An object moves at speed v1 with respect to
frame S(cid:16). And frame S(cid:16) moves at speed v2 with respect to frame S, in the same
direction as the motion of the object (see Fig. 11.18). What is the speed, u, of the
object with respect to frame S?

Relativity (Kinematics)

The Lorentz transformations can be used to easily answer this question. The
relative speed of the frames is v2. Consider two events along the object’s path (for
example, say it makes two beeps). We are given that (cid:16)x(cid:16)/(cid:16)t(cid:16) = v1. Our goal is
to find u ≡ (cid:16)x/(cid:16)t. The Lorentz transformations from S(cid:16) to S, Eqs. (11.17), are

(cid:16)x = γ2((cid:16)x

1 + v1v2/c2 .

(11.31)

This is the velocity-addition formula, for adding velocities along the same line.
Let’s look at some of its properties.

• It is symmetric with respect to v1 and v2, as it should be, because we could switch the

roles of the object and frame S.

• For v1v2 (cid:4) c2, it reduces to u ≈ v1 + v2, which we know holds perfectly well for

everyday speeds.

• If v1 = c or v2 = c, then we find u = c, as should be the case, because anything that

moves with speed c in one frame moves with speed c in another.

• The maximum (or minimum) of u in the region −c ≤ v1, v2 ≤ c equals c (or −c),
which can be seen by noting that ∂u/∂v1 and ∂u/∂v2 are never zero in the interior of
the region.

If you take any two velocities that are less than c and add them according to
Eq. (11.31), then you will obtain a velocity that is again less than c. This shows
that no matter how much you keep accelerating an object (that is, no matter how
many times you give the object a speed v1 with respect to the frame moving at
speed v2 that it was just in), you can’t bring the speed up to the speed of light.
We’ll give another argument for this result in Chapter 12 when we discuss energy.

Adding the speeds can be fun.

Remark: Consider the two scenarios shown in Fig. 11.19. If the goal is to find the velocity of
A with respect to C, then the velocity-addition formula applies to both scenarios, because the
second scenario is the same as the first one, as observed in B’s frame.

The velocity-addition formula applies when we ask, “If A moves at v1 with respect to B,
and B moves at v2 with respect to C (which means, of course, that C moves at speed v2 with
respect to B), then how fast does A move with respect to C?” The formula does not apply if we
ask the more mundane question, “What is the relative speed of A and C, as viewed by B?” The
answer to this is just v1 + v2.

In short, if the two velocities are given with respect to the same observer, say B, and if
you are asking for the relative velocity as measured by B, then you simply have to add the
velocities.30 But if you are asking for the relative velocity as measured by A or C, then you
have to use the velocity-addition formula. It makes no sense to add velocities that are measured
with respect to different observers. Doing so would involve adding things that are measured
in different coordinate systems, which is meaningless. In other words, taking the velocity of
A with respect to B and adding it to the velocity of B with respect to C, hoping to obtain the
velocity of A with respect to C, is invalid. ♣

Example (Passing trains, again): Consider again the scenario in the “Passing
trains” example in Section 11.3.3.

(a) How long, as viewed by A and as viewed by B, does it take for A to overtake B?
(b) Let event E1 be “the front of A passing the back of B”, and let event E2 be “the
back of A passing the front of B.” Person D walks at constant speed from the
back of B to the front (see Fig. 11.20), such that he coincides with both events
E1 and E2. How long does the “overtaking” process take, as viewed by D?

(11.32)

The γ factor associated with this speed is γ = 13/12. Therefore, B sees
A’s train contracted to a length 12L/13. During the overtaking, A must travel a
distance equal to the sum of the lengths of the trains in B’s frame (see Fig. 11.21),
which is L + 12L/13 = 25L/13. Since A moves at speed 5c/13, the total time
in B’s frame is

tB = 25L/13
5c/13

= 5L

.

(11.33)

The exact same reasoning holds from A’s point of view, so we have
tA = tB = 5L/c.

30 Note that the resulting speed can certainly be greater than c. If I see a ball heading toward me at
0.9c from the right, and another one heading toward me at 0.9c from the left, then the relative
speed of the balls in my frame is 1.8c. In the frame of one of the balls, however, the relative speed
is (1.8/1.81)c ≈ (0.9945)c, from Eq. (11.31).

(b) Look at things from D’s point of view. D is at rest, and the two trains move
with equal and opposite speeds v (see Fig. 11.22), because otherwise the second
event E2 wouldn’t be located at D. The relativistic addition of v with itself is
the speed of A as viewed by B. But from part (a), we know that this relative
speed equals 5c/13. Therefore,

where we have ignored the unphysical solution, v = 5c. The γ factor associated

Remarks: There are a few double-checks we can perform. The speed of D with respect
to the ground can be obtained either via B’s frame by relativistically adding 3c/5 and c/5,
or via A’s frame by subtracting c/5 from 4c/5. These both give the same answer, namely
5c/7, as they must. (The c/5 speed can in fact be determined by this reasoning, instead of
using Eq. (11.34).) The γ factor between the ground and D is therefore 7/2
6. We can
then use time dilation to say that someone on the ground sees the overtaking take a time
6)tD (we can say this because both events happen right at D). Using Eq. (11.35),
of (7/2
this gives a ground-frame time of 7L/c, in agreement with Eq. (11.15). Likewise, the γ

Note that we cannot use simple time dilation to relate the ground to A or B, because
the two events don’t happen at the same place in the train frames. But since both events
happen at the same place in D’s frame, namely right at D, it’s legal to use time dilation to
go from D’s frame to any other frame. ♣

Remark:
y is small and v is
large, this result can be seen to be a special case of time dilation, in the following way. Consider
a series of equally spaced lines parallel to the x axis (see Fig. 11.24). Imagine that the object’s
clock ticks once every time it crosses a line. Since u(cid:16)
y is small, the object’s frame is essentially
frame S(cid:16). So if S flies by to the left, then the object is essentially moving at speed v with respect
to S. Therefore, S sees the clock run slow by a factor γ . This means that S sees the object cross
the lines at a slower rate, by a factor γ (because the clock still ticks once every time it crosses
a line; this is a frame-independent statement). Since distances in the y direction are the same
in the two frames, we conclude that uy = u(cid:16)

Technically, we should also subtract off ((cid:16)y)2 and ((cid:16)z)2, but nothing exciting
happens in the transverse directions, so we’ll ignore them. Using Eq. (11.17),
we can write ((cid:16)s)2 in terms of the S(cid:16) coordinates, (cid:16)x(cid:16) and (cid:16)t(cid:16). The result is

Relativity (Kinematics)

We see that the Lorentz transformations imply that the quantity c2t2 − x2 doesn’t
depend on the frame. This result is more than we bargained for, for the following
reason. The speed-of-light postulate says that if c2t(cid:16)2 − x(cid:16)2 = 0, then c2t2 −
x2 = 0. But Eq. (11.40) says that if c2t(cid:16)2 − x(cid:16)2 = b, then c2t2 − x2 = b, for
any value of b, not just zero. This is, as you might guess, very useful. There are
enough things that change when we go from one frame to another, so it’s nice
to have a frame-independent quantity that we can hang on to. The fact that s2 is
invariant under Lorentz transformations of x and t is exactly analogous to the fact
that r2 is invariant under rotations in the x-y plane. The coordinates themselves
change under the transformation, but the special combination of c2t2 − x2 for
Lorentz transformations, or x2 + y2 for rotations, remains the same. All inertial
observers agree on the value of s2, independent of what they measure for the
actual coordinates.

“Potato?! Potahto!” said she,
“And of course it’s tomahto, you see.
But the square of ct
Minus x2 will be
Always something on which we agree.”

A note on terminology: The separation in the coordinates, (c(cid:16)t, (cid:16)x), is usually
referred to as the spacetime interval, while the quantity ((cid:16)s)2 ≡ c2((cid:16)t)2 −((cid:16)x)2
is referred to as the invariant interval (or technically the square of the invariant
interval). At any rate, just call it s2, and people will know what you mean. The
invariance of s2 is actually just a special case of more general results involving
inner products and 4-vectors, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 13. Let’s now
look at the physical significance of s2 ≡ c2t2 − x2; there are three cases to
consider.

Case 1: s 2 > 0 (timelike separation)
In this case, we say that the two events are timelike separated. We have c2t2 > x2,
and so |x/t| < c. Consider a frame S(cid:16) moving at speed v with respect to S. The
Lorentz transformation for x is

(cid:16) = γ (x − vt).

x

(11.41)

Since |x/t| < c, there exists a v that is less than c (namely v = x/t) that makes
x(cid:16) = 0. In other words, if two events are timelike separated, it is possible to
find a frame S(cid:16) in which the two events happen at the same place. (In short, the
condition |x/t| < c means that it is possible for a particle to travel from one event
to the other.) The invariance of s2 then gives s2 = c2t(cid:16)2 − x(cid:16)2 = c2t(cid:16)2. So we see
that s/c is the time between the events in the frame in which the events occur at
the same place. This time is called the proper time.

11.6 The invariant interval

535

Case 2: s 2 < 0 (spacelike separation)
In this case, we say that the two events are spacelike separated.31 We have
c2t2 < x2, and so |t/x| < 1/c. Consider a frame S(cid:16) moving at speed v with
respect to S. The Lorentz transformation for t(cid:16) is

(cid:16) = γ (t − vx/c2).

t

(11.42)

Since |t/x| < 1/c, there exists a v that is less than c (namely v = c2t/x) that
makes t(cid:16) = 0. In other words, if two events are spacelike separated, it is possible
to find a frame S(cid:16) in which the two events happen at the same time. (This statement
is not as easy to see as the corresponding one in the timelike case above. But if
you draw a Minkowski diagram, described in the next section, it becomes clear.)
The invariance of s2 then gives s2 = c2t(cid:16)2 − x(cid:16)2 = −x(cid:16)2. So we see that |s| is the
distance between the events in the frame in which the events occur at the same
time. This distance is called the proper distance, or proper length.

Case 3: s 2 = 0 (lightlike separation)
In this case, we say that the two events are lightlike separated. We have c2t2 = x2,
and so |x/t| = c. This holds in every frame, so in every frame a photon emitted
at one of the events will arrive at the other. It is not possible to find a frame S(cid:16)
in which the two events happen at the same place or the same time, because the
frame would have to travel at the speed of light.

Relativity (Kinematics)

Solution: The only quantity that we’ll need that we haven’t already found in the two
examples above is the distance between E1 and E2 in C’s frame (the ground frame).
In this frame, train A travels at a rate 4c/5 for a time tC = 7L/c, covering a distance
of 28L/5. But event E2 occurs at the back of the train, which is a distance 3L/5
behind the front end (this is the contracted length in the ground frame). Therefore,
the distance between events E1 and E2 in the ground frame is 28L/5 − 3L/5 = 5L.
You can also apply the same line of reasoning using train B, in which the 5L result
takes the form, (3c/5)(7L/c) + 4L/5.

Putting the previous results together, we have the following separations between

the events in the various frames:

From the table, we see that (cid:16)s2 ≡ c2(cid:16)t2 − (cid:16)x2 = 24L2 for all four frames, as
desired. We could have worked backwards, of course, and used the s2 = 24L2 result
from frames A, B, or D, to deduce that (cid:16)x = 5L in frame C. In Problem 11.10, you
are asked to perform the tedious task of checking that the values in the above table
satisfy the Lorentz transformations between the six different pairs of frames.

11.7 Minkowski diagrams

Minkowski diagrams (sometimes called “spacetime” diagrams) are extremely
useful in seeing how coordinates transform between different reference frames.
If you want to produce exact numbers in a problem, you’ll probably have to use
one of the strategies we’ve encountered so far. But as far as getting an overall
intuitive picture of a setup goes (if there is in fact any such thing as intuition in
relativity), there is no better tool than a Minkowski diagram. Here’s how you
make one.

Let frame S(cid:16) move at speed v with respect to frame S (along the x axis, as
usual, and ignore the y and z components). Draw the x and ct axes of frame S.32
What do the x(cid:16) and ct(cid:16) axes of S(cid:16) look like, superimposed on this diagram? That
is, at what angles are the axes inclined, and what is the size of one unit on these
axes? (There is no reason why one unit on the x(cid:16) and ct(cid:16) axes should have the
same length on the paper as one unit on the x and ct axes.) We can answer these
questions by using the Lorentz transformations, Eqs. (11.17). We’ll first look at
the ct(cid:16) axis, and then the x(cid:16) axis.

32 We choose to plot ct instead of t on the vertical axis, so that the trajectory of a light beam lies at

a nice 45

angle. Alternatively, we could choose units where c = 1.

Look at the point (x(cid:16), ct(cid:16)) = (0, 1), which lies on the ct(cid:16) axis, one ct(cid:16) unit from
the origin (see Fig. 11.26). Equations (11.17) tell us that this point is the point
(x, ct) = (γ v/c, γ ). The angle between the ct(cid:16) and ct axes is therefore given by
tan θ1 = x/ct = v/c. With β ≡ v/c, we have

tan θ1 = β.

(11.45)

Alternatively, the ct(cid:16) axis is simply the “worldline” of the origin of S(cid:16). (Aworldline
is the path an object takes as it travels through spacetime.) The origin moves at
speed v with respect to S. Therefore, points on the ct(cid:16) axis satisfy x/t = v, or
x/ct = v/c.

On the paper, the point (x(cid:16), ct(cid:16)) = (0, 1), which we just found to be the point
1 + v2/c2 from the origin. Therefore, using

(cid:4)

as measured on a grid where the x and ct axes are orthogonal. This ratio
approaches infinity as β → 1. And it of course equals 1 if β = 0.

x (cid:16)-axis angle and unit size
The same basic argument holds here. Look at the point (x(cid:16), ct(cid:16)) = (1, 0), which
lies on the x(cid:16) axis, one x(cid:16) unit from the origin (see Fig. 11.26). Equations (11.17)
tell us that this point is the point (x, ct) = (γ , γ v/c). The angle between the x(cid:16)
and x axes is therefore given by tan θ2 = ct/x = v/c. So, as in the ct(cid:16)-axis case,

tan θ2 = β.

(11.47)

On the paper, the point (x(cid:16), ct(cid:16)) = (1, 0), which we just found to be the point
1 + v2/c2 from the origin. So, as in the

as measured on a grid where the x and ct axes are orthogonal. Both the x(cid:16) and
ct(cid:16) axes are therefore stretched by the same factor, and tilted in by the same
angle, relative to the x and ct axes. This “squeezing in” of the axes in a Lorentz
transformation is different from what happens in a rotation, where both axes
rotate in the same direction.

If v/c ≡ β = 0, then θ1 = θ2 = 0, so the ct(cid:16) and x(cid:16) axes coincide with the ct and

Relativity (Kinematics)

the 45◦ light-ray line. Note that since θ1 = θ2, the light-ray line bisects the x(cid:16) and ct(cid:16) axes.
Therefore (as we verified above), the scales on these axes must be the same, because a light
ray must satisfy x(cid:16) = ct(cid:16). ♣

We now know what the x(cid:16) and ct(cid:16) axes look like. Given any two points in
a Minkowski diagram (that is, given any two events in spacetime), we can just
read off the (cid:16)x, (cid:16)ct, (cid:16)x(cid:16), and (cid:16)ct(cid:16) quantities that our two observers measure,
assuming that our graph is accurate enough. Although these quantities must of
course be related by the Lorentz transformations, the advantage of a Minkowski
diagram is that you can actually see geometrically what’s going on.

There are very useful physical interpretations of the ct(cid:16) and x(cid:16) axes. If you
stand at the origin of S(cid:16), then the ct(cid:16) axis is the “here” axis, and the x(cid:16) axis is the
“now” axis (the line of simultaneity). That is, all events on the ct(cid:16) axis take place
at your position (the ct(cid:16) axis is your worldline, after all), and all events on the x(cid:16)
axis take place simultaneously (they all have t(cid:16) = 0).

Example (Length contraction): For both parts of this problem, use a Minkowski
diagram where the axes in frame S are orthogonal.

The analysis used in the above example also works for time intervals.

task of Exercise 11.63.

11.8 The Doppler effect

11.8.1 Longitudinal Doppler effect
Consider a source that emits flashes at frequency f (cid:16) (in its own frame) while
moving directly toward you at speed v, as shown in Fig. 11.29. With what fre-
quency do the flashes hit your eye? In these Doppler-effect problems, you must
be careful to distinguish between the time at which an event occurs in your frame,
and the time at which you see the event occur. This is one of the few situations
where we are concerned with the latter.

There are two effects contributing to the longitudinal Doppler effect. The first
is relativistic time dilation. There is more time between the flashes in your frame,
which means that they occur at a smaller frequency. The second is the everyday

v

c

Fig. 11.29

540

Relativity (Kinematics)

Doppler effect (as with sound), arising from the motion of the source. Successive
flashes have a smaller (or larger, if v is negative) distance to travel to reach your
eye. This effect increases (or decreases, if v is negative) the frequency at which
the flashes hit your eye.

Let’s now be quantitative and find the observed frequency. The time between
emissions in the source’s frame is (cid:16)t(cid:16) = 1/f (cid:16). The time between emissions in
your frame is then (cid:16)t = γ (cid:16)t(cid:16), by the usual time dilation. So the photons of one
flash have traveled a distance (in your frame) of c(cid:16)t = cγ (cid:16)t(cid:16) by the time the
next flash occurs. During this time between emissions, the source has traveled a
distance v(cid:16)t = vγ (cid:16)t(cid:16) toward you in your frame. Therefore, at the instant the
next flash occurs, the photons of this next flash are a distance (in your frame) of
c(cid:16)t − v(cid:16)t = (c − v)γ (cid:16)t(cid:16) behind the photons of the previous flash. This result
holds for all adjacent flashes. The time, (cid:16)T , between the arrivals of the flashes
at your eye is 1/c times this distance, so we have

(cid:16)T = 1

(cid:16)

.

(11.50)

(11.51)

If β > 0 (that is, the source is moving toward you), then f > f (cid:16). The everyday
Doppler effect wins out over the time-dilation effect. In this case we say that
the light is “blueshifted,” because blue light is at the high-frequency end of the
visible spectrum. The light need not have anything to do with the color blue, of
course; by “blue” we just mean that the frequency is increased. If β < 0 (that
is, the source is moving away from you), then f < f (cid:16). Both effects serve to
decrease the frequency. In this case we say that the light is “redshifted,” because
red light is at the low-frequency end of the visible spectrum.

Remark: We can also derive Eq. (11.51) by working in the frame of the source. In this frame,
the distance between successive flashes is c(cid:16)t(cid:16). And since you are moving toward the source at
speed v, the relative speed of you and a given flash is c + v. So the time between your running
into successive flashes is c(cid:16)t(cid:16)/(c + v) = (cid:16)t(cid:16)/(1 + β), as measured in the frame of the source.
But your clock runs slow in this frame, so a time of only (cid:16)T = (1/γ )(cid:16)t(cid:16)/(1 + β) elapses on
your watch, which you can show agrees with the time in Eq. (11.50).

We certainly needed to obtain the same result by working in the frame of the source, because
the principle of relativity states that the result can’t depend on which object we consider to be
the one at rest; there is no preferred frame. This is different from the situation with the standard
nonrelativistic Doppler effect (relevant to a siren moving toward you), because the frequency
there does depend on whether you or the source is the one that is moving. The reason for this is
that when we say “moving” here, we mean moving with respect to the rest frame of the air, which
is the medium that sound travels in. We therefore do in fact have a preferred frame of reference,
unlike in relativity (where there is no “ether”). Using the arguments given above for the two
different frames, but without the γ factors, you can show that the two nonrelativistic Doppler

11.8 The Doppler effect

541

results are f = f (cid:16)/(1 − β) if the source is moving toward a stationary you, and f = (1 + β)f (cid:16)
if you are moving toward the stationary source. Here β is the ratio of the speed of the moving
object to the speed of sound. In view of these two different results, the relativistic Doppler
effect can be considered to be a simpler effect, in the sense that there is only one frequency to
remember. ♣

11.8.2 Transverse Doppler effect

Let’s now consider a two-dimensional situation. Consider a source that emits
flashes at frequency f (cid:16) (in its own frame), while moving across your field of
vision at speed v. There are two reasonable questions we can ask about the
frequency you observe:

y

v

(case 1)

x

x

Fig. 11.30

y

v

(case 2)

Fig. 11.31

• Case 1: At the instant the source is at its closest approach to you, with what frequency

do the flashes hit your eye?

• Case 2: When you see the source at its closest approach to you, with what frequency

do the flashes hit your eye?

The difference between these two scenarios is shown in Fig. 11.30 and
Fig. 11.31, where the source’s motion is taken to be parallel to the x axis. In
the first case, the photons you see must have been emitted at an earlier time,
because the source moves during the nonzero time it takes the light to reach you.
In this scenario, we are dealing with photons that hit your eye when (as measured
in your frame) the source crosses the y axis. You therefore see the photons come
in at an angle with respect to the y axis.

In the second case, you see the photons come in along the y axis (by the
definition of this scenario). At the instant you observe one of these photons, the
source is at a position past the y axis. Let’s find the observed frequencies in these
two cases.
Case 1: Let your frame be S, and let the source’s frame be S(cid:16). Consider the
situation from S(cid:16)’s point of view. S(cid:16) sees you moving across his field of vision at
speed v. The relevant photons hit your eye when you cross the y(cid:16) axis (defined to
be the axis that passes through the source) of the S(cid:16) frame. S(cid:16) sees you get hit by
a flash every (cid:16)t(cid:16) = 1/f (cid:16) seconds in his frame. (This is true because when you
are very close to the y(cid:16) axis, all points on your path are essentially equidistant
from the source. So we don’t have to worry about any longitudinal effects, in the
S(cid:16) frame.) This means that you get hit by a flash every (cid:16)T = (cid:16)t(cid:16)/γ = 1/(f (cid:16)γ )
seconds in your frame, because S(cid:16) sees your clock running slow. Therefore, the
frequency in your frame is

f = 1
(cid:16)T

= γ f

(cid:16) =

(cid:4)

f (cid:16)
1 − β2

.

(11.52)

Hence, f is greater than f (cid:16). You see the flashes at a higher frequency than S(cid:16) emits
them.

542

Relativity (Kinematics)

Case 2: Again, let your frame be S, and let the source’s frame be S(cid:16). Consider
the situation from your point of view. Because of time dilation, a clock on the
source runs slow (in your frame) by a factor of γ . So you get hit by a flash
every (cid:16)T = γ (cid:16)t(cid:16) = γ /f (cid:16) seconds in your frame. (We have used the fact that
the relevant photons are emitted from points that are essentially equidistant from
you. So they all travel the same distance, and we don’t have to worry about any
longitudinal effects, in your frame.) When you see the source cross the y axis,
you therefore observe a frequency of

f = 1
(cid:16)T

= 1
γ (cid:16)t(cid:16)

= f (cid:16)
γ

(cid:4)

(cid:16)

= f

1 − β2.

(11.53)

Hence, f is smaller than f (cid:16). You see the flashes at a lower frequency than S(cid:16) emits
them.

When people talk about the “transverse Doppler effect,” they sometimes mean
Case 1, and they sometimes mean Case 2. The title “transverse Doppler” is
therefore ambiguous, so you should remember to state exactly which scenario
you are talking about. Other cases that are “in between” these two can also be
considered. But they get a bit messy.

R

(case 1)

Remarks:

1. The two scenarios may alternatively be described, respectively (as you can convince

yourself), in the following ways (see Fig. 11.32).

• Case 1: A receiver moves with speed v in a circle around a source. What frequency

does the receiver register?

• Case 2: A source moves with speed v in a circle around a receiver. What frequency

R

(case 2)

does the receiver register?

Fig. 11.32

These two setups make it clear that the results in Eqs. (11.52) and (11.53) arise from a
simple time-dilation argument used by the inertial object at the center of each circle.
These setups involve accelerating objects. We must therefore invoke the fact (which has
plenty of experimental verification) that if an inertial observer looks at a moving clock,
then only the instantaneous speed of the clock is important in computing the time-dilation
factor. The acceleration is irrelevant.34

2. Beware of the following incorrect reasoning for Case 1, leading to an incorrect version of
Eq. (11.52). “S sees things in S(cid:16) slowed down by a factor γ (that is, (cid:16)t = γ (cid:16)t(cid:16)), by the
usual time-dilation effect. Hence, S sees the light flashing at a slower pace. Therefore,
f = f (cid:16)/γ .” This reasoning puts the γ in the wrong place. Where is the error? The error
lies in confusing the time at which an event occurs in S’s frame, with the time at which S
sees (with his eyes) the event occur. The flashes certainly occur at a lower frequency in
S, but due to the motion of S(cid:16) relative to S, it turns out that the flashes meet S’s eye at a
faster rate, because the source is moving slightly toward S while it is emitting the relevant
photons. You can work out the details from S’s point of view.35

34 The acceleration is, however, very important if things are considered from an accelerating object’s

point of view. But we’ll wait until Chapter 14 on General Relativity to talk about this.

35 This is a fun exercise (Exercise 11.66), but it should convince you that it’s much easier to look at
things in the frame in which there are no longitudinal effects, as we did in our solutions above.

11.9 Rapidity

543

Alternatively, the error can be stated as follows. The time dilation result, (cid:16)t = γ (cid:16)t(cid:16),
rests on the assumption that the (cid:16)x(cid:16) between the two events is zero. This applies fine
to two emissions of light from the source. However, the two events in question are the
absorption of two light flashes by your eye (which is moving in S(cid:16)), so (cid:16)t = γ (cid:16)t(cid:16) is not
applicable. Instead, (cid:16)t(cid:16) = γ (cid:16)t is the relevant result, valid when (cid:16)x = 0. (But we still
need to invoke the fact that all the relevant photons travel the same distance, which means
that we don’t have to worry about any longitudinal effects.) ♣

11.9 Rapidity

11.9.1 Deﬁnition
Let us define the rapidity, φ, by

tanh φ ≡ β ≡

v

c

.

(11.54)

A few properties of the hyperbolic trig functions are given in Appendix A.
In particular, tanh φ ≡ (eφ − e−φ)/(eφ + e−φ). The rapidity defined in Eq.
(11.54) is very useful in relativity because many of our expressions take on a
particularly nice form when written in terms of it. Consider, for example, the
velocity-addition formula. Let β1 = tanh φ1 and β2 = tanh φ2. Then if we add
β1 and β2 using the velocity-addition formula, Eq. (11.31), we obtain

β1 + β2
1 + β1β2

= tanh φ1 + tanh φ2
1 + tanh φ1 tanh φ2

= tanh(φ1 + φ2),

(11.55)

where we have used the addition formula for tanh φ, which you can prove by
writing things in terms of the exponentials, e±φ. Therefore, while the velocities
add in the strange manner of Eq. (11.31), the rapidities add by standard addition.
The Lorentz transformations also take a nice form when written in terms of

the rapidity. Our friendly γ factor can be written as

γ ≡

1(cid:4)

1 − β2

1(cid:15)

=

1 − tanh2φ

= cosh φ.

(11.56)

Also,

γβ ≡

(cid:4)

tanh φ

=

(cid:15)

(11.57)

Therefore, the Lorentz transformations in matrix form, Eqs. (11.22), become

(11.59)

544

Relativity (Kinematics)

except that we now have hyperbolic trig functions instead of trig functions.
The fact that the interval s2 ≡ c2t2 − x2 does not depend on the frame is
clear from Eq. (11.58), because the cross terms in the squares cancel, and
cosh2φ − sinh2φ = 1. (Compare with the invariance of r2 ≡ x2 + y2 for rota-
tions in a plane, where the cross terms from Eq. (11.59) likewise cancel, and
cos2θ + sin2θ = 1.)

The quantities associated with a Minkowski diagram also take a nice form
when written in terms of the rapidity. The angle between the S and S(cid:16) axes
satisfies

tan θ = β = tanh φ.

11.9.2 Physical meaning

The fact that the rapidity makes many of our formulas look nice and pretty is
reason enough to consider it. But in addition, it turns out to have a very meaningful
physical interpretation. Consider the following setup. A spaceship is initially at
rest in the lab frame. At a given instant, it starts to accelerate. Let a be the
proper acceleration, which is defined as follows. Let t be the time coordinate
in the spaceship’s frame.36 If the proper acceleration is a, then at time t + dt,
the spaceship is moving at speed a dt relative to the frame it was in at time t.
An equivalent definition is that the astronaut feels a force of ma applied to his
body by the spaceship. If he is standing on a scale, then the scale shows a reading
of F = ma.

What is the relative speed of the spaceship and the lab frame at (the spaceship’s)
time t? We can answer this question by considering two nearby times and using
the velocity-addition formula, Eq. (11.31). From the definition of a, Eq. (11.31)
gives, with v1 ≡ a dt and v2 ≡ v(t),

v(t + dt) =

v(t) + a dt
1 + v(t)a dt/c2 .

(11.62)

36 This frame is of course changing as time goes by, because the spaceship is accelerating. The time
, but we don’t want

t is simply the spaceship’s proper time. Normally, we would denote this by t
to have to keep writing the primes over and over in the following calculation.

dz/(1−z2) = tanh−1z,38 and

v(t) = c tanh(at/c).

(11.64)

For small a or small t (more precisely, for at/c (cid:4) 1), we obtain v(t) ≈ at, as
we should (because tanh z ≈ z for small z, which follows from the exponential
form of tanh). And for at/c (cid:6) 1, we obtain v(t) ≈ c, as we should. If a happens
to be a function of time, a(t), then we can’t take the a outside the integral in
Eq. (11.63), so we instead end up with the general formula,

v(t) = c tanh

φ(t) ≡ 1

0
Note that whereas v has c as a limiting value, φ can become arbitrarily large.
Looking at Eq. (11.65) we see that the φ associated with a given v is 1/mc times
the time integral of the force (felt by the astronaut) that is needed to bring the
astronaut up to speed v. By applying a force for an arbitrarily long time, we can
make φ arbitrarily large.

The integral

a(t) dt may be described as the naive, incorrect speed. That is,
it is the speed that the astronaut might think he has, if he has his eyes closed and
knows nothing about the theory of relativity. And indeed, his thinking would be
F(t) dt/m looks
essentially correct for small speeds. This quantity
like a reasonably physical thing, so it seems like it should have some meaning.
And indeed, although it doesn’t equal v, all you have to do to get v is take a tanh
and throw in some factors of c.

a(t) dt =

(cid:17)

The fact that rapidities add via simple addition when using the velocity-
addition formula, as we saw in Eq. (11.55), is evident from Eq. (11.65). There is
really nothing more going on here than the fact that

(11.67)

37 Equivalently, just take the derivative of (v + w)/(1 + vw/c2) with respect to w, and then set

w = 0.

38 Alternatively, you can use 1/(1 − z2) = 1/(2(1 − z)) + 1/(2(1 + z)), and then integrate to obtain
some logs, which then yield the tanh. You can also use the result of Problem 11.17 to find v(t).
See the remark in the solution to that problem (after trying to solve it, of course!).

To be explicit, let a force be applied from t0 to t1 that brings a mass up to a speed
of (dropping the c’s) β1 = tanh φ1 = tanh
, and then let an additional
force be applied from t1 to t2 that adds on an additional speed of β2 = tanh φ2 =
tanh
, relative to the frame at t1. Then the resulting speed may be looked
at in two ways: (1) it is the result of relativistically adding the speeds β1 = tanh φ1
and β2 = tanh φ2, and (2) it is the result of applying the force from t0 to t2 (you
get the same final speed, of course, whether or not you bother to record the speed
along the way at t1), which is β = tanh
= tanh(φ1 + φ2), where the
second equality comes from the statement, Eq. (11.67), that integrals simply add.
Therefore, the relativistic addition of tanh φ1 and tanh φ2 gives tanh(φ1 + φ2),
as we wanted to show. Note that this reasoning doesn’t rely on the fact that the
function here is a tanh. It could be anything. If we lived in a world where the
speed were given by, for example, β = tan
, then the rapidities would
still add via simple addition. It’s just that in our world we have a tanh. (We’ll see
in the next section that a “tan” world would have issues, anyway.)

11.10 Relativity without c

In Section 11.2, we introduced the two postulates of Special Relativity, namely the
speed-of-light postulate and the relativity postulate. Appendix I gives a derivation
of the Lorentz transformations that works directly from these two postulates and
doesn’t use the three fundamental effects, which were the basis of the derivation
in Section 11.4.1. It’s interesting to see what happens if we relax these postulates.
It’s hard to imagine a reasonable (empty) universe where the relativity postulate
doesn’t hold, but it’s easy to imagine a universe where the speed of light depends
on the reference frame. Light could behave like a baseball, for example. So
let’s drop the speed-of-light postulate now and see what we can say about the
coordinate transformations between frames, using only the relativity postulate.
For further discussion of this topic, see Lee and Kalotas (1975) and references
therein.

In Appendix I, the form of the transformations, just prior to invoking the

speed-of-light postulate, is given in Eq. (I.8) as

x = Av(x

We’ll put a subscript on A in this section, to remind us of the v dependence.

All we’ve done so far is make a change of variables. But we now make the
following claim.

Claim 11.1 V 2

v is independent of v.

Proof: As stated in the last remark in Section 11.4.1, we know that two suc-
cessive applications of the transformations in Eqs. (11.70) must again yield a
transformation of the same form. Consider a transformation characterized by
velocity v1, and another one characterized by velocity v2. For simplicity, define

V1 ≡ Vv1, V2 ≡ Vv2 ,

To calculate the composite transformation, it is easiest to use matrix notation.
Looking at Eqs. (11.70), we see that the composite transformation is given by
the matrix

The composite transformation must still be of the form of Eqs. (11.70). But this
implies that the upper-left and lower-right entries of the composite matrix must

be equal. Therefore, V 2

v must be a constant. So it is independent of v.

Denote the constant value of V 2

v by V 2. Then the coordinate transforma-

We have obtained this result using only the relativity postulate. These trans-
formations have the same form as the Lorentz transformations in Eqs. (11.17).

548

Relativity (Kinematics)

The only extra information in Eqs. (11.17) is that V equals the speed of light, c.
It is remarkable that we were able to prove so much by using only the relativity
postulate.

We can say a few more things. There are four basic possibilities for the value

of V 2. However, two of these are not physical.

• V 2 = ∞: This gives the Galilean transformations, x = x
• 0 < V 2 < ∞: This gives transformations of the Lorentz type. V is the limiting speed
of an object. Experiments show that this case is the one that corresponds to the world
we live in.

and t = t

.

(cid:16) + vt

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

• V 2 = 0: This case isn’t physical, because any nonzero value of v makes the γ factor

imaginary (and infinite). Nothing could ever move.

• V 2 < 0: It turns out that this case is also not physical. You might be concerned that the
square of V is less than zero, but this is fine because V appears in the transformations
(11.73) only through its square. There is no need for V to actually be the speed of
anything. The trouble is that the nature of Eqs. (11.73) implies the possibility of time
reversal. This opens the door for causality violation and all the other problems associated
with time reversal. We therefore reject this case. To be more explicit, define b2 ≡ −V 2,
where b is a positive number. Then Eqs. (11.73) may be written in the form,

(cid:16)

x = x

bt = −x

cos θ + (bt
(cid:16)

sin θ + (bt

(cid:16)) sin θ,
(cid:16)) cos θ,

(11.74)

where tan θ ≡ v/b. Also, −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, because the positive sign of the x
and t
coefficients in Eqs. (11.73) implies that the cos θ in Eqs. (11.74) satisfies cos θ ≥ 0. We
have the normal trig functions in Eqs. (11.74) instead of the hyperbolic trig functions
in the Lorentz transformation in Eqs. (11.58). This present transformation is simply a
rotation of the axes through an angle θ in the plane. The S axes are rotated counter-
(cid:16)
clockwise (as you can check) by an angle θ relative to the S
axes. Equivalently, the S
axes are rotated clockwise by an angle θ relative to the S axes.

Equations (11.74) satisfy the requirement that the composition of two transformations
is again a transformation of the same form. Rotation by θ1, and then by θ2, yields a
rotation by θ1 + θ2. However, if θ1 and θ2 are positive, and if the resulting rotation is
◦
through an angle θ that is greater than 90
, then we have a problem. The tangent of such
an angle is negative. Therefore, tan θ = v/b implies that v is negative.

11.11 Problems

549

An equivalent method of dismissing this case, given in Lee and Kalotas (1977), but one
that doesn’t specifically refer to causality violation, is to note that the transformations
in Eqs. (11.74) don’t form a closed group. In other words, successive applications
of the transformations can eventually yield a transformation that isn’t of the form in
Eqs. (11.74), due to the −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 restriction. (In contrast, the rotations in a
plane form a closed group, because there are no restrictions on what θ can be.) This
argument is equivalent to the time-reversal argument above, because −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2
is equivalent to cos θ ≥ 0, which is equivalent to the statement that the coefficients of
t and t

in Eqs. (11.74) have the same sign.

(cid:16)

Note that all of the finite 0 < V 2 < ∞ possibilities are essentially the same.
Any difference in the numerical value of V can be absorbed into the definitions
of the unit sizes for x and t. Given that V is finite, it has to be something, so
it doesn’t make sense to put much importance on its numerical value. There is
therefore only one decision to be made when constructing the spacetime structure
of an (empty) universe. You just have to say whether V is finite or infinite, that
is, whether the universe is Lorentzian or Galilean. Equivalently, all you have to
say is whether or not there is an upper limit on the speed of any object. If there
is, then you can simply postulate the existence of something that moves with this
limiting speed. In other words, to create your universe, you simply have to say,
“Let there be light.”

11.1. No transverse length contraction *

Two meter sticks, A and B, move past each other as shown in Fig. 11.34.
Stick A has paint brushes on its ends. Use this setup to show that in the
frame of one stick, the other stick still has a length of one meter.

11.2. Explaining time dilation **

Two planets, A and B, are at rest with respect to each other, a distance L
apart, with synchronized clocks. A spaceship flies at speed v past planet
A toward planet B and synchronizes its clock with A’s right when it
passes A (they both set their clocks to zero). The spaceship eventually
flies past planet B and compares its clock with B’s. We know, from
working in the planets’ frame, that when the spaceship reaches B, B’s
clock reads L/v. And the spaceship’s clock reads L/γ v, because it runs
slow by a factor of γ when viewed in the planets’ frame.

How would someone on the spaceship quantitatively explain to you
why B’s clock reads L/v (which is more than its own L/γ v), considering
that the spaceship sees B’s clock running slow?

11.3. Explaining length contraction **

Two bombs lie on a train platform, a distance L apart. As a train passes
by at speed v, the bombs explode simultaneously (in the platform frame)
and leave marks on the train. Due to the length contraction of the train,
we know that the marks on the train are a distance γ L apart when viewed
in the train’s frame, because this distance is what is length-contracted
down to the given distance L in the platform frame.

How would someone on the train quantitatively explain why the marks
are a distance γ L apart, considering that the bombs are a distance of only
L/γ apart in the train frame?

11.4. A passing stick **

A stick of length L moves past you at speed v. There is a time interval
between the front end coinciding with you and the back end coinciding
with you. What is this time interval in

(a) your frame? (Calculate this by working in your frame.)
(b) your frame? (Work in the stick’s frame.)
(c) the stick’s frame? (Work in your frame. This is the tricky one.)
(d) the stick’s frame? (Work in the stick’s frame.)

11.5. Rotated square **

A square with side L flies past you at speed v, in a direction parallel
to two of its sides. You stand in the plane of the square. When you see
the square at its nearest point to you, show that it looks to you like it is
rotated, instead of contracted. (Assume that L is small compared with
the distance between you and the square.)

11.6. Train in a tunnel **

A train and a tunnel both have proper lengths L. The train moves toward
the tunnel at speed v. A bomb is located at the front of the train. The
bomb is designed to explode when the front of the train passes the far
end of the tunnel. A deactivation sensor is located at the back of the train.
When the back of the train passes the near end of the tunnel, the sensor
tells the bomb to disarm itself. Does the bomb explode?

11.7. Seeing behind the stick **

A ruler is positioned perpendicular to a wall, and you stand at rest with
respect to the ruler and the wall. A stick of length L flies by at speed v.
It travels in front of the ruler, so that it obscures part of the ruler from
your view. When the stick hits the wall it stops. Which of the following
two reasonings is correct (and what is wrong with the incorrect one)?

In your reference frame, the stick is shorter than L. Therefore, right
before it hits the wall, you are able to see a mark on the ruler that is
closer than L units to the wall (see Fig. 11.35).

But in the stick’s frame, the marks on the ruler are closer together.
Therefore, when the wall hits the stick, the closest mark to the wall that
you can see on the ruler is greater than L units (see Fig. 11.35).

11.8. Cookie cutter **

Cookie dough (chocolate chip, of course) lies on a conveyor belt that
moves at speed v. A circular stamp stamps out cookies as the dough
rushes by beneath it. When you buy these cookies in a store, what shape
are they? That is, are they squashed in the direction of the belt, stretched
in that direction, or circular?

11.9. Getting shorter **

Two balls move with speed v along a line toward two people standing
along the same line. The proper distance between the balls is γ L, and
the proper distance between the people is L. Due to length contraction,
the people measure the distance between the balls to be L, so the balls
pass the people simultaneously (as measured by the people), as shown in
Fig. 11.36. Assume that the people’s clocks both read zero at this time.
If the people catch the balls, then the resulting proper distance between
the balls becomes L, which is shorter than the initial proper distance of
γ L. Your task: By working in the frame in which the balls are initially at
rest, explain how the proper distance between the balls decreases from
γ L to L. Do this in the following way.

(a) Draw the beginning and ending pictures for the process. Indicate
the readings on both clocks in the two pictures, and label all
relevant lengths.

(b) Using the distances labeled in your pictures, how far do the people
travel? Using the times labeled in your pictures, how far do the
people travel? Show that these two methods give the same result.
(c) Explain in words how the proper distance between the balls

decreases from γ L to L.

what is the ratio of the distances CB and AC (assume that A and C

with velocity v in the x direction. What should v be so that you also

is of course v = 0. Find the other one.

11.14. Relative speed *

In the lab frame, two particles move with speed v along the paths
shown in Fig. 11.40. The angle between the trajectories is 2θ. What is
the speed of one particle, as viewed by the other? (Note: This problem
is posed again in Chapter 13, where it can be solved in a much simpler
way, using 4-vectors.)

11.15. Another relative speed **

In the lab frame, particles A and B move with speeds u and v along
the paths shown in Fig. 11.41. The angle between the trajectories is θ.
What is the speed of one particle, as viewed by the other? (Note: This
problem is posed again in Chapter 13, where it can be solved in a much
simpler way, using 4-vectors.)

11.16. Transverse velocity addition **
For the special case of u(cid:16)
= 0, the transverse velocity-addition for-
x
mula, Eq. (11.38), yields uy = u(cid:16)
/γ . Derive this in the following way:
y
In frame S(cid:16), a particle moves with velocity (0, u(cid:16)), as shown in the first
picture in Fig. 11.42. Frame S moves to the left with speed v, so the sit-
uation in S looks like what is shown in the second picture in Fig. 11.42,
with the y speed now u. Consider a series of equally spaced dotted
lines, as shown. The ratio of the times between passes of the dotted
lines in frames S and S(cid:16) is TS /TS(cid:16) = u(cid:16)/u. Derive another expression
for this ratio by using time-dilation arguments, and then equate the two
expressions to solve for u in terms of u(cid:16) and v.

An object moves at speed v1/c ≡ β1 with respect to S1, which moves

addition formula, Eq. (11.31)) in the following way (don’t use time
dilation, length contraction, etc; use only the relativity postulate and
the fact that the speed of light is the same in any inertial frame):

Let the ball be thrown from the back of the train. At the same instant,
a photon is released next to it (see Fig. 11.44). The photon heads to the
front of the train, bounces off a mirror, heads back, and eventually runs
into the ball. In both the frame of the train and the frame of the ground,
calculate the fraction of the way along the train where the meeting
occurs, and then equate these fractions.

11.19. Modified twin paradox ***

Consider the following variation of the twin paradox. A, B, and C each
have a clock. In A’s reference frame, B flies past A with speed v to
the right. When B passes A, they both set their clocks to zero. Also, in
A’s reference frame, C starts far to the right and moves to the left with
speed v. When B and C pass each other, C sets his clock to read the
same as B’s. Finally, when C passes A, they compare the readings on
their clocks. At this moment, let A’s clock read TA, and let C’s clock
read TC.

(a) Working in A’s frame, show that TC = TA/γ , where γ =

(cid:4)

1/

1 − v2/c2.

(b) Working in B’s frame, show again that TC = TA/γ .
(c) Working in C’s frame, show again that TC = TA/γ .

respect to the train. How much time does this take, and what distance
does the ball cover, in:

(a) The train frame?

In a given reference frame, Event 1 happens at x = 0, ct = 0, and
Event 2 happens at x = 2, ct = 1 (in units of some specified length).
Find a frame in which the two events are simultaneous.

Consider the Minkowski diagram in Fig. 11.45. In frame S, the hyper-
bola c2t2 − x2 = 1 is drawn. Also drawn are the axes of frame S(cid:16),
which moves past S with speed v. Use the invariance of the interval
s2 = c2t2 − x2 to derive the ratio of the unit sizes on the ct(cid:16) and ct axes,
and check your result with Eq. (11.46).

11.23. Velocity addition via Minkowski **

An object moves at speed v1 with respect to frame S(cid:16). Frame S(cid:16) moves
at speed v2 with respect to frame S (in the same direction as the motion
of the object). What is the speed, u, of the object with respect to frame
S? Solve this problem (that is, derive the velocity-addition formula)
by drawing a Minkowski diagram with frames S and S(cid:16), drawing the
worldline of the object, and doing some geometry.

11.24. Clapping both ways **

Twin A stays on the earth, and twin B flies to a distant star and back. For
both of the following setups, draw a Minkowski diagram that explains
what is happening.

11.11 Problems

(a) Throughout the trip, B claps in such a way that his claps occur
at equal time intervals (cid:16)t in A’s frame. At what time intervals
do the claps occur in B’s frame?

(b) Now let A clap in such a way that his claps occur at equal time
intervals (cid:16)t in B’s frame. At what time intervals do the claps
occur in A’s frame? (Be careful on this one. The sum of all
the time intervals must equal the increase in A’s age, which is
greater than the increase in B’s age, as we know from the usual
twin paradox.)

11.25. Acceleration and redshift ***

Use a Minkowski diagram to solve the following problem: Two people
stand a distance d apart. They simultaneously start accelerating in the
same direction (along the line between them) with the same proper
acceleration a. At the instant they start to move, how fast does each
person’s clock tick in the (changing) frame of the other person?

11.26. Break or not break? ***

Two spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other. They
are connected by a string (see Fig. 11.46). The string is strong, but it can-
not withstand an arbitrary amount of stretching. At a given instant, the
spaceships simultaneously (with respect to their initial inertial frame)
start accelerating in the same direction (along the line between them)
with the same constant proper acceleration. In other words, assume
they bought identical engines from the same store, and they put them
on the same setting. Will the string eventually break?

Show that if you apply an L.T. with v1 = tanh φ1, and then another
one with v2 = tanh φ2, the result is an L.T. with v = tanh(φ1 + φ2).

11.28. Accelerator’s time **

A spaceship is initially at rest in the lab frame. At a given instant, it
starts to accelerate. Let this happen when the lab clock reads t = 0
and the spaceship clock reads t(cid:16) = 0. The proper acceleration is a.
(That is, at time t(cid:16) + dt(cid:16), the spaceship is moving at speed a dt(cid:16) relative

556

Relativity (Kinematics)

to the frame it was in at time t(cid:16).) Later on, a person in the lab measures
t and t(cid:16). What is the relation between them?

11.12 Exercises

Section 11.3: The fundamental effects

11.29. Effectively speed c *

A rocket flies between two planets that are one light-year apart. What
should the rocket’s speed be so that the time elapsed on the captain’s
watch is one year?

11.30. A passing train *

A train of length 15 cs moves at speed 3c/5. 39 How much time does
it take to pass a person standing on the ground (as measured by that
person)? Solve this by working in the frame of the person, and then
again by working in the frame of the train.

11.31. Overtaking a train *

Train A has length L. Train B moves past A (on a parallel track, facing
the same direction) with relative speed 4c/5. The length of B is such
that A says that the fronts of the trains coincide at exactly the same time
as the backs coincide. What is the time difference between the fronts
coinciding and the backs coinciding, as measured by B?

11.32. Walking on a train *

A train of proper length L and speed 3c/5 approaches a tunnel of
length L. At the moment the front of the train enters the tunnel, a per-
son leaves the front of the train and walks (briskly) toward the back.
She arrives at the back of the train right when it (the back) leaves the
tunnel.

(a) How much time does this take in the ground frame?
(b) What is the person’s speed with respect to the ground?
(c) How much time elapses on the person’s watch?

11.33. Simultaneous waves *

Alice flies past Bob at speed v. Right when she passes, they both set
their watches to zero. When Alice’s watch shows a time T , she waves
to Bob. Bob then waves to Alice simultaneously (as measured by him)
with Alice’s wave (so this is before he actually sees her wave). Alice
then waves to Bob simultaneously (as measured by her) with Bob’s
wave. Bob then waves to Alice simultaneously (as measured by him)

39 1 cs is one “light-second.” It equals (1)(3 · 108 m/s)(1 s) = 3 · 108 m.

11.12 Exercises

557

with Alice’s second wave. And so on. What are the readings on Alice’s
watch for all the times she waves? And likewise for Bob?

11.34. Here and there *

A train of proper length L travels past you at speed v. A person on the
train stands at the front, next to a clock that reads zero. At this moment
in time (as measured by you), a clock at the back of the train reads
Lv/c2. How would you respond to the following statement:

“The person at the front of the train can leave the front right after
the clock there reads zero, and then run to the back and get there right
before the clock there reads Lv/c2. You (on the ground) will therefore
see the person simultaneously at both the front and the back of the train
when the clocks there read zero and Lv/c2, respectively.”

11.35. Photon on a train *

A train of proper length L has clocks at the front and back. A photon is
fired from the back of the train to the front. Working in the train frame,
we can easily say that if the photon leaves the back of the train when
the clock there reads zero, then it arrives at the front when the clock
there reads L/c.

Now consider this setup in the ground frame, where the train travels
by at speed v. Rederive the above result (that the difference in the
readings of the two clocks is L/c) by working only in the ground frame.

11.36. Triplets *

Triplet A stays on the earth. Triplet B travels at speed 4c/5 to a planet
(a distance L away) and back. Triplet C travels out to the planet at speed
3c/4, and then returns at the necessary speed to arrive back exactly
when B does. How much does each triplet age during this process?
Who is youngest?

11.37. Seeing the light **

A and B leave from a common point (with their clocks both reading
zero) and travel in opposite directions with relative speed v. When B’s
clock reads T , he (B) sends out a light signal. When A receives the
signal, what time does his (A’s) clock read? Answer this question by
doing the calculation entirely in (a) A’s frame, and then (b) B’s frame.
(This problem is basically a derivation of the longitudinal Doppler
effect, discussed in Section 11.8.1.)

11.38. Two trains and a tree **

Two trains of proper length L move toward each other in opposite
directions on parallel tracks. They both move at speed v with respect
to the ground. Both trains have clocks at the front and back, and these

558

Relativity (Kinematics)

clocks are synchronized as usual in the frame of the train they are in.
A tree is located on the ground at the place where the fronts of the
trains pass each other. The clocks at the fronts of the trains both read
zero when they pass. Find the reading on the clocks at the backs of the
trains when they (the backs) pass each other at the tree. Do this in three
different ways:

(a) Imagine that you stand next to the tree on the ground, and you

observe what one of the rear clocks is doing.

(b) Imagine that you are on one of the trains, and you observe what
your own rear clock is doing during the time the tree travels the
relevant distance.

(c) Imagine that you are on one of the trains, and you observe what
the other train’s rear clock is doing during the time the tree travels
the relevant distance. (You’ll need to use velocity addition.)

11.39. Twice simultaneous **

A train of proper length L moves at speed v with respect to the ground.
When the front of the train passes a tree on the ground, a ball is simul-
taneously (as measured in the ground frame) thrown from the back of
the train toward the front, with speed u with respect to the train. What
should u be so that the ball hits the front simultaneously (as measured
in the train frame) with the tree passing the back of the train? Show that
in order for a solution for u to exist, we must have v/c < (
5 − 1)/2,
which happens to be the inverse of the golden ratio.

√

11.40. People clapping **

Two people stand a distance L apart along an east–west road. They both
clap their hands at precisely noon in the ground frame. You are driving
eastward down this road at speed 4c/5. You notice that you are next
to the western person at the same instant (as measured in your frame)
that the eastern person claps. Later on, you notice that you are next to
a tree at the same instant (as measured in your frame) that the western
person claps. Where is the tree along the road? (Describe its location
in the ground frame.)

11.41. Photon, tree, and house **

(a) A train of proper length L moves at speed v with respect to the
ground. At the instant the back of the train passes a certain tree,
someone at the back of the train shines a photon toward the front.
The photon happens to hit the front of the train at the instant the
front passes a certain house. As measured in the ground frame,
how far apart are the tree and the house? Solve this by working
in the ground frame.

11.12 Exercises

559

(b) Now look at the setup from the point of view of the train frame.
Using your result for the tree–house distance from part (a), verify
that the house meets the front of the train at the same instant the
photon meets it.

11.42. Tunnel fraction **

A person runs with speed v toward a tunnel of length L. A light source
is located at the far end of the tunnel. At the instant the person enters
the tunnel, the light source simultaneously (as measured in the tunnel
frame) emits a photon that travels down the tunnel toward the person.
When the person and the photon eventually meet, the person’s location
is a fraction f along the tunnel. What is f ? Solve this by working in the
tunnel frame, and then again by working in the person’s frame.

11.43. Overlapping trains **

An observer on the ground sees two trains, A and B, both of proper
length L, move in opposite directions at speed v with respect to the
ground. She notices that when the trains “overlap,” clocks at the front
of A and rear of B both read zero. From the “rear clock ahead” effect,
she therefore also notices that clocks at the rear of A and front of B
read Lv/c2 and −Lv/c2, respectively (as shown in Fig. 11.47). Now
imagine riding along on A. When the rear of B passes the front of your
train (A), clocks at both of these places read zero (as stated above).
Explain, by working only in the frame of A, why clocks at the back of
A and the front of B read Lv/c2 and −Lv/c2, respectively, when these
points coincide. (You’ll need to use velocity addition.)

A stick, oriented horizontally, falls and bounces off the ground. Qual-
itatively, what does this look like in the frame of someone running by
at speed v?

11.45. Through the hole? **

A stick of proper length L moves at speed v in the direction of its length.
It passes over an infinitesimally thin sheet that has a hole of diameter L
cut in it. As the stick passes over the hole, the sheet is raised so that the
stick passes through the hole and ends up underneath the sheet. Well,
maybe . . .

In the lab frame, the stick’s length is contracted to L/γ , so it appears
to easily make it through the hole. But in the stick frame, the hole is
contracted to L/γ , so it appears that the stick does not make it through
the hole (or rather, the hole doesn’t make it around the stick, since the
hole is what is moving in the stick frame). So the question is: Does the
stick end up on the other side of the sheet or not?

11.46. Short train in a tunnel **

Consider the scenario in Problem 11.6, with the only change being that
the train now has length rL, where r is some numerical factor. What
is the largest value of r, in terms of v, for which it is possible for the
bomb not to explode? Verify that you obtain the same answer working
in the train frame and working in the tunnel frame.

11.47. Successive L.T.’s **

Show that the combination of an L.T. (with speed v1) and an L.T. (with
speed v2) yields an L.T. with speed u = (v1 + v2)/(1 + v1v2/c2).

11.48. Loss of simultaneity **

A train moves at speed v with respect to the ground. Two events occur
simultaneously, a distance L apart, in the train frame. What are the time
and space separations in the ground frame? Solve this by:

(a) Using the Lorentz transformations.
(b) Using only the results in Section 11.3. Do this by working in the
ground frame, and then again by working in the train frame.

11.49. Some γ’s *

Show that the relativistic addition (or subtraction) of the velocities u
and v has a γ factor given by γ = γuγv(1 ± uv).

11.50. Slanted time dilation *

A clock moves vertically with speed u in a given frame, and you run
horizontally with speed v with respect to this frame. Show that you see
the clock run slow by the nice simple factor, γuγv.

11.51. Pythagorean triples *

Let (a, b, h) be a Pythagorean triple. (We’ll use h to denote the
hypotenuse, instead of c, for obvious reasons.) Consider the relativis-
tic addition or subtraction of the two speeds, β1 = a/h and β2 = b/h.
Show that the numerator and denominator of the result are the leg and
hypotenuse of another Pythagorean triple, and find the other leg. What
is the associated γ factor?

11.52. Running away *

A and B both start at the origin and simultaneously head off in opposite
directions at speed 3c/5 with respect to the ground. A moves to the
right, and B moves to the left. Consider a mark on the ground at x = L.

11.12 Exercises

561

As viewed in the ground frame, A and B are a distance 2L apart when A
passes this mark. As viewed by A, how far away is B when A coincides
with the mark?

11.53. Angled photon *

A photon moves at an angle θ with respect to the x(cid:16) axis in frame S(cid:16).
Frame S(cid:16) moves at speed v with respect to frame S (along the x(cid:16) axis).
Calculate the components of the photon’s velocity in S, and verify that
the speed is c.

11.54. Running on a train **

A train of proper length L moves at speed v1 with respect to the ground.
A passenger runs from the back of the train to the front at speed v2
with respect to the train. How much time does this take, as viewed by
someone on the ground? Solve this in two different ways:

(a) Find the relative speed of the passenger and the train (as viewed
by someone on the ground), and then find the time it takes for
the passenger to erase the initial “head start” that the front of the
train had.

(b) Find the time elapsed on the passenger’s clock (by working in
whatever frame you want), and then use time dilation to get the
time elapsed on a ground clock.

11.55. Velocity addition **

The fact that the previous exercise can be solved in two different ways
suggests a method of deriving the velocity-addition formula: A train of
proper length L moves at speed v1 with respect to the ground. A ball is
thrown from the back of the train to the front at speed v2 with respect
to the train. Let the speed of the ball with respect to the ground be V .
Calculate the time of the ball’s journey, as measured by an observer
on the ground, in the following two different ways, and then set them
equal to solve for V in terms of v1 and v2. (This gets a bit messy. And
yes, you have to solve a quadratic.)

(a) First way: Find the relative speed of the ball and the train (as
viewed by someone on the ground), and then find the time it
takes for the ball to erase the initial “head start” that the front of
the train had.

(b) Second way: Find the time elapsed on the ball’s clock (by work-
ing in whatever frame you want), and then use time dilation to
get the time elapsed on a ground clock.

11.56. Velocity addition again **

A train of proper length L moves at speed v with respect to the ground.
A ball is thrown from the back of the train to the front at speed u with

562

Relativity (Kinematics)

respect to the train. When finding the time of this process in the ground
frame, a common error is to use time dilation to go from the train frame
to the ground frame, which gives an incorrect answer of γv(L/u). This
is incorrect because time dilation is valid only if the two relevant events
occur at the same place in one of the frames; otherwise simultaneity
becomes an issue.

(a) Find the total time in the ground frame correctly by looking
at how much a clock at rest in the train frame advances (for
example, a clock at the front of the train), and by applying time
dilation to this clock.

(b) Find the total time in the ground frame by applying time dilation
to the ball’s clock. Your answer will contain the unknown speed
V of the ball with respect to the ground.

(c) Equate your results from parts (a) and (b) to show that γV =
γuγv(1 + uv/c2). Then solve for V to produce the velocity-
addition formula.

11.57. Bullets on a train **

A train moves at speed v. Bullets are successively fired at speed u
(relative to the train) from the back of the train to the front. A new
bullet is fired at the instant (as measured in the train frame) the previous
bullet hits the front. In the frame of the ground, what fraction of the
way along the train is a given bullet, at the instant (as measured in the
ground frame) the next bullet is fired? What is the maximum number
of bullets that are in flight at a given instant, in the ground frame?

11.58. Time dilation and Lv/c2

**

A person walks very slowly at speed u from the back of a train of
proper length L to the front. The time-dilation effect in the train frame
can be made arbitrarily small by picking u to be sufficiently small
(because the effect is second order in u). Therefore, if the person’s
watch agrees with a clock at the back of the train when he starts, then
it also (essentially) agrees with a clock at the front when he finishes.

Now consider this setup in the ground frame, where the train moves
at speed v. The rear clock reads Lv/c2 more than the front, so in view of
the preceding paragraph, the time gained by the person’s watch during
the process must be Lv/c2 less than the time gained by the front clock.
By working in the ground frame, explain why this is the case. Assume
u (cid:4) v. 40

40 If you line up a collection of these train systems around the circumference of a rotating platform,
then the above result implies the following fact. Let person A be at rest on the platform, and let
person B walk arbitrarily slowly around the circumference. Then when B returns to A, B’s clock
will read less than A’s. This is true because the above reasoning shows (as you will figure out)

Person A stands on the ground, train B with proper length L moves to
the right at speed 3c/5, and person C runs to the right at speed 4c/5.
C starts behind the train and eventually passes it. Let event E1 be “C
coincides with the back of the train,” and let event E2 be “C coincides
with the front of the train.” Find the (cid:16)t and (cid:16)x between the events E1
and E2 in the frames of A, B, and C, and show that c2(cid:16)t2 − (cid:16)x2 is the

(a) In A’s frame?
(b) In B’s frame?
(c) In the ground frame?
(d) Verify that the invariant interval is the same in all three frames.

11.61. Throwing on a train **

A train with proper length L moves at speed 3c/5 with respect to the
ground. A ball is thrown from the back to the front, at speed c/2 with
respect to the train. How much time does this take, and what distance
does the ball cover, in:

(a) The train frame?
(b) The ground frame? Solve this by

i. Using a velocity-addition argument.
ii. Using the Lorentz transformations to go from the train frame

(c) The ball frame?
(d) Verify that the invariant interval is indeed the same in all three

frames.

(e) Show that the times in the ball frame and ground frame are

related by the relevant γ factor.

that an inertial observer sees B’s clock running slower than A’s. This result, that you can walk
arbitrarily slowly in a particular reference frame and have your clock lose synchronization with
other clocks, is a consequence of the fact that in some accelerating reference frames it is impossible
to produce a consistent method (that is, one without a discontinuity) of clock synchronization. See
Cranor et al. (2000) for more details.

11.66. Transverse Doppler **

As mentioned in Remark 2 of Section 11.8.2, it is possible to solve the
transverse Doppler effect for Case 1 by working in the frame of the
observer, provided that you account for the longitudinal component
of the source’s motion. Solve the problem this way and reproduce
Eq. (11.52).

11.67. Twin paradox via Doppler **

Twin A stays on the earth, and twin B flies at speed v to a distant star
and back. The star is a distance L from the earth in the earth–star frame.
Use the Doppler effect to show that B is younger by a factor γ when
she returns (don’t use any time dilation or length contraction results).
Do this in the following two ways; both are doable by working in either
A’s frame or B’s frame(s), so take your pick.

(a) A sends out flashes at intervals of t seconds (as measured
in his frame). By considering the numbers of redshifted and
blueshifted flashes that B receives, show that TB = TA/γ .

as measured by the earth. Check the large and small L (compared
with c2/a) limits.

(b) By working in the (changing) frame of the spaceship, find the
time of the journey, as measured by the spaceship (an implicit
equation is fine). Check the small L limit. How does the time
behave for large L?

11.13 Solutions

11.1. No transverse length contraction

Assume that the paint brushes are capable of leaving marks on stick B if B is long
enough, or if A is short enough. The key fact we need here is the second postulate of
relativity, which says that the frames of the sticks are equivalent. That is, if A sees
B shorter than (or longer than, or equal to) itself, then B also sees A shorter than (or
longer than, or equal to) itself. The contraction factor must be the same when going
each way between the frames.

Assume (in search of a contradiction) that A sees B shortened. Then B won’t extend
out to the ends of A, so there will be no marks on B. But in this case, B must also
see A shortened, so there will be marks on B (see Fig. 11.48). This is a contradiction.
Likewise, if we assume that A sees B lengthened, we also reach a contradiction. We
are therefore left with only the third possibility, namely that each stick sees the other
stick as one meter long.

11.2. Explaining time dilation

The resolution to the apparent paradox is the “head start” that B’s clock has over A’s
clock, as seen in the spaceship frame. From Eq. (11.6), we know that in the spaceship
frame, B’s clock reads Lv/c2 more than A’s. (The two planets may be considered to
be at the ends of the train in the example in Section 11.3.1.)

Therefore, what a person on the spaceship says is: “My clock advances by L/γ v
during the whole trip. I see B’s clock running slow by a factor γ , so I see B’s clock
advance by only (L/γ v)/γ = L/γ 2v. However, B’s clock started not at zero but at
Lv/c2. Therefore, the final reading on B’s clock when I get there is

11.3. Explaining length contraction

The resolution to the apparent paradox is that the explosions do not occur simulta-
neously in the train frame. As the platform rushes past the train, the “rear” bomb
explodes before the “front” bomb explodes.41 The front bomb then gets to travel
farther by the time it explodes and leaves its mark. The distance between the marks
is therefore larger than you might naively expect. Let’s be quantitative about this.

Let the two bombs contain clocks that read zero when they explode (they are
synchronized in the platform frame). Then in the train frame, the front bomb’s clock
reads only −Lv/c2 when the rear bomb explodes when showing a time of zero.
(This is the “rear clock ahead” result from Eq. (11.6).) The front bomb’s clock must
therefore advance by a time of Lv/c2 before it explodes. But the train sees the bombs’
clocks running slow by a factor γ , so in the train frame the front bomb explodes a
time γ Lv/c2 after the rear bomb explodes. During this time of γ Lv/c2, the platform
moves a distance (γ Lv/c2)v relative to the train.

Therefore, what a person on the train says is: “Due to length contraction, the
distance between the bombs is L/γ . The front bomb is therefore a distance L/γ ahead
of the rear bomb when the latter explodes. The front bomb then travels an additional
distance of γ Lv2/c2 by the time it explodes, at which point it is a distance of

11.4. A passing stick

(a) The stick has length L/γ in your frame, and it moves with speed v. Therefore,

the time taken in your frame to cover the distance L/γ is L/γ v.

(b) The stick sees you fly by at speed v. The stick has length L in its own frame, so
the time elapsed in the stick frame is L/v. During this time, the stick sees the
watch on your wrist run slow by a factor γ . Therefore, a time of L/γ v elapses
on your watch, in agreement with part (a).

Logically, the two solutions in (a) and (b) differ in that one uses length
contraction and the other uses time dilation. Mathematically, they differ simply
in the order in which the divisions by γ and v occur.

(c) You see the rear clock on the stick showing a time of Lv/c2 more than the front
clock. In addition to this head start, more time will of course elapse on the rear
clock by the time it reaches you. The time in your frame is L/γ v (because the
stick has length L/γ in your frame). But the stick’s clocks run slow, so a time
of only L/γ 2v will elapse on the rear clock by the time it reaches you. The total
additional time (compared with the front clock’s reading when it passed you)
that the rear clock shows is therefore

(d) The stick sees you fly by at speed v. The stick has length L in its own frame,

so the time elapsed in the stick frame is L/v.

41 Since we’ll be working in the train frame here, we’ll use the words “rear” and “front” in the way
that someone on the train uses them as she watches the platform rush by. That is, if the train is
heading east with respect to the platform, then from the point of view of the train, the platform
is heading west, so the eastern bomb on the platform is the rear one, and the western bomb is
the front one. So they have the opposite orientation compared with the way that someone on the
platform labels the rear and front of the train. Using the same orientation would entail writing the
phrase “front clock ahead” below, which would make me cringe.

11.5. Rotated square

Figure 11.49 shows a top view of the square at the instant (in your frame) when it is
closest to you. Its length is contracted along the direction of motion, so it takes the
shape of a rectangle with sides L and L/γ . This is what the shape is in your frame
(where is-ness is defined by where all the points of an object are at simultaneous
times). But what does the square look like to you? That is, what is the nature of the
photons hitting your eye at a given instant?42

Photons from the far side of the square have to travel an extra distance L to get to
your eye, compared with photons from the near side. So they need an extra time L/c
of flight. During this time L/c, the square moves a distance Lv/c ≡ Lβ sideways.
Therefore, referring to Fig. 11.50, a photon emitted at point A reaches your eye at
the same time as a photon emitted from point B. This means that the trailing side of
the square spans a distance Lβ across your field of vision, while the near side spans
1 − β2 across your field of vision. But this is exactly what a
a distance L/γ = L
rotated square of side L looks like, as shown in Fig. 11.51, where the angle of rotation
satisfies sin θ = β. For the case of a circle instead of a square, see Hollenbach (1976).

11.6. Train in a tunnel

Yes, the bomb explodes. This is clear in the frame of the train (see Fig. 11.52). In
this frame, the train has length L, and the tunnel speeds past it. The tunnel is length-
contracted down to L/γ . Therefore, the far end of the tunnel passes the front of the
train before the near end passes the back, so the bomb explodes.

We can, however, also look at things in the frame of the tunnel (see Fig. 11.53). Here
the tunnel has length L, and the train is length-contracted down to L/γ . Therefore,
the deactivation device gets triggered before the front of the train passes the far end
of the tunnel, so you might think that the bomb does not explode. We appear to have
a paradox.

The resolution to this paradox is that the deactivation device cannot instantaneously
tell the bomb to deactivate itself. It takes a finite time for the signal to travel the
length of the train from the sensor to the bomb. And it turns out that this transmission
time makes it impossible for the deactivation signal to get to the bomb before the
bomb gets to the far end of the tunnel, no matter how fast the train is moving. Let’s
show this.

The signal has the best chance of winning this “race” if it has speed c, so let’s
assume this is the case. Now, the signal gets to the bomb before the bomb gets to
the far end of the tunnel if and only if a light pulse emitted from the near end of the
tunnel (at the instant the back of the train goes by) reaches the far end of the tunnel
before the front of the train does. The former takes a time L/c. The latter takes a time
L(1 − 1/γ )/v, because the front of the train is already a distance L/γ through the
tunnel. So if the bomb is not to explode, we must have

L/c < L(1 − 1/γ )/v

This is never true. Therefore, the signal always arrives too late, and the bomb always

42 In relativity problems, we virtually always subtract off the time it takes light to travel from the
object to your eye (that is, we find out what really is). But along with the Doppler effect discussed
in Section 11.8, this problem is one of the few exceptions where we actually want to determine
what your eye registers.

11.7. Seeing behind the stick

The first reasoning is correct. You will be able to see a mark on the ruler that is less
than L units from the wall. You will actually be able to see a mark even closer to the
wall than L/γ , as we’ll show below.

The error in the second reasoning (in the stick’s frame) is that the second picture in
Fig. 11.35 is not what you see. This second picture shows where things are at simul-
taneous times in the stick’s frame, which are not simultaneous times in your frame.
Alternatively, the error is the implicit assumption that signals travel instantaneously.
But in fact the back of the stick cannot know that the front of the stick has been hit
by the wall until a finite time has passed. During this time, the ruler (and the wall
and you) travels farther to the left, allowing you to see more of the ruler. Let’s be
quantitative about this and calculate (in both frames) the closest mark to the wall that
you can see.

Consider your reference frame. The stick has length L/γ . Therefore, when the stick
hits the wall, you can see a mark a distance L/γ from the wall. You will, however,
be able to see a mark even closer to the wall, because the back end of the stick will
keep moving forward, since it doesn’t know yet that the front end has hit the wall.
The stopping signal (shock wave, etc.) takes time to travel.

Let’s assume that the stopping signal travels along the stick at speed c. (We could
instead work with a general speed u, but the speed c is simpler, and it yields an upper
bound on the closest mark you can see.) Where will the signal reach the back end?
Starting from the time the stick hits the wall, the signal travels backward from the wall
at speed c, while the back end of the stick travels forward at speed v (from a point L/γ
away from the wall). So the relative speed (as viewed by you) of the signal and the
back end is c + v. Therefore, the signal hits the back end after a time (L/γ )/(c + v).
During this time, the signal has traveled a distance c(L/γ )/(c + v) from the wall.
The closest point to the wall that you can see on the ruler is therefore the mark with
the value

(cid:13)

L
γ (1 + β)

= L

1 − β
1 + β .

(11.81)

Now consider the stick’s reference frame. The wall is moving to the left toward the
stick at speed v. After the wall hits the right end of the stick, the signal moves to
the left with speed c, while the wall keeps moving to the left with speed v. Where
is the wall when the signal reaches the left end? The wall travels v/c as fast as the
signal, so it travels a distance Lv/c in the time that the signal travels the distance L.
This means that the wall is L(1 − v/c) away from the left end of the stick. In the
stick’s frame, this corresponds to a distance γ L(1 − v/c) on the ruler, because the
ruler is length contracted. So the left end of the stick is at the mark with the value

(cid:13)

Lγ (1 − β) = L

1 − β
1 + β ,

(11.82)

in agreement with Eq. (11.81).

11.8. Cookie cutter

Let the diameter of the cookie cutter be L, and consider the two following reasonings.

• In the lab frame, the dough is length contracted, so the diameter L corresponds
to a distance larger than L (namely γ L) in the dough’s frame. Therefore, when
you buy a cookie, it is stretched out by a factor γ in the direction of the belt.43

43 The shape is an ellipse, since that’s what a stretched-out circle is. The eccentricity of an ellipse is
the focal distance divided by the semi-major axis length. As an exercise, you can show that this
equals β ≡ v/c here.

11.13 Solutions

569

• In the frame of the dough, the cookie cutter is length contracted down to L/γ in
the direction of motion. So in the frame of the dough, the cookies have a length
of only L/γ . Therefore, when you buy a cookie, it is squashed by a factor γ in
the direction of the belt.

Which reasoning is correct? The first one is. The cookies are stretched out. The fallacy
in the second reasoning is that the various parts of the cookie cutter do not strike the
dough simultaneously in the dough frame. What the dough sees is this: Assuming
that the cutter moves to the left, the right side of the cutter stamps the dough, then
nearby parts of the cutter stamp it, and so on, until finally the left side of the cutter
stamps the dough. But by this time the front (that is, the left) of the cutter has moved
farther to the left. So the cookie turns out to be longer than L. It takes a little work to
demonstrate (by working in the dough frame) that the length is actually γ L, but let’s
do that now.

Consider the moment when the rightmost point of the cutter strikes the dough. In
the dough frame, a clock at the rear (the right side) of the cutter reads Lv/c2 more than
a clock at the front (the left side). The front clock must therefore advance by Lv/c2
by the time it strikes the dough. (This is true because all points on the cutter strike
the dough simultaneously in the cutter frame. Hence, all cutter clocks read the same
when they strike.) But due to time dilation, this takes a time γ (Lv/c2) in the dough
frame. During this time, the cutter travels a distance v(γ Lv/c2). Since the front of
the cutter was initially a distance L/γ (due to length contraction) ahead of the back,
the total length of the cookie in the dough frame is

11.9. Getting shorter

(a) In the frame in which the balls are initially at rest, the beginning picture (when
the left person catches the left ball when his clock reads zero) is shown in
Fig. 11.54. The balls are a distance γ L apart, and the people’s separation is
length contracted down to L/γ . The front person’s clock is Lv/c2 behind the
back person’s clock, so it reads −Lv/c2.

The ending picture (when the right person catches the right ball when his
clock reads zero) is shown in Fig. 11.55. By the time the right person catches
the ball, the left person has moved to the right while holding the left ball. The
left person’s clock is ahead, so it reads Lv/c2.

(b) By looking at the distances in the figures, we see that the people travel a distance

γ L − L/γ .

Let’s now use the clock readings to get the distance. The total time for the
process is γ (Lv/c2) because each person’s clock advances by Lv/c2, but these
clocks run slow in the frame we’re working in. Since the speed of the people is
v, the distance they travel is v(γ Lv/c2). This had better be equal to γ L − L/γ .
And it is, because

If we then shift to the frame in which everything is at rest, we see that the proper
distance between the balls is L, as we wanted to show.

(c) To sum up, the proper distance between the balls decreases because in the frame
in which the balls are initially at rest, the left person catches the left ball first
and then drags it closer to the right ball by the time the right person catches
that one. So it all comes down to the loss of simultaneity.

“+.” In the AB case, for example, we’ll write “Frames B and A,” in that order, to
signify that the B coordinates are on the left-hand side and the A coordinates are on
the right-hand side. We’ll simply list the L.T.’s for the six cases, and you can check

First solution: Let C move at speed v with respect to the ground, and let the relative
speed of C and both A and B be u (as viewed by C). Then two different expressions
for u are the relativistic subtraction of v from 4c/5, and the relativistic subtraction of
3c/5 from v. Therefore (dropping the c’s),

(11.86)

This gives 0 = 35v2 −74v+35 = (5v−7)(7v−5). Since the v = 7/5 root represents
a speed larger than c, we must have

v = 5
7

c.

(11.87)

Plugging this back into Eq. (11.86) gives u = c/5.
Second solution: With v and u defined as above, two different expressions for v
are the relativistic subtraction of u from 4c/5, and the relativistic addition of u to
3c/5. Therefore,

This gives 0 = 5u2 − 26u + 5 = (5u − 1)(u − 5). Since the u = 5 root represents a
speed larger than c, we must have

u = c

.

(11.89)

Plugging this back into Eq. (11.88) gives v = 5c/7.
Third solution: The relative speed of A and B is

as in the second solution.

11.12. More equal speeds

Let u be the speed at which C sees A and B approaching her. So u is the desired speed
of C with respect to B, that is, the ground. From C’s point of view, the given speed v
is the result of relativistically adding u with another u. Therefore (dropping the c’s),

v = 2u

Relativity (Kinematics)

The quadratic equation for u also has a solution with a plus sign in front of the square
root, but this solution cannot be correct, because it is greater than 1 (and in fact goes
to infinity as v goes to zero). The above solution for u has the proper limit as v goes
to zero, namely u → v/2, which can be obtained by using the Taylor expansion for
the square root.

The ratio of the distances CB and AC in the lab frame is the same as the ratio of the
differences in the velocities in the lab frame (because both A and C run into B at the
same time, so you could imagine running the scenario backwards in time). Therefore,

(11.93)

We see that C is γ times as far from B as she is from A, as measured in the lab frame.
Note that for nonrelativistic speeds, we have γ ≈ 1, so C is midway between A and B,
as expected. An intuitive reason for the simple factor of γ is the following. Imagine
that A and B are carrying identical jousting sticks as they run toward C. Consider
what the situation looks like when the tips of the sticks reach C. In the lab frame (in
which B is at rest), B’s stick is uncontracted, but A’s stick is length contracted by a
factor γ . Therefore, in the lab frame, A is closer to C than B is, by a factor γ .

11.13. Equal transverse speeds

From your point of view, the lab frame is moving with speed v in the negative x
direction. The transverse velocity-addition formula, Eq. (11.38), therefore gives the
y speed in your frame as uy/γ (1 − uxv). Demanding that this equals uy gives

or v = 0, of course. This v is simply the relativistic addition of ux with itself. This
makes sense, because it means that both your frame and the original lab frame move
with speed ux (but in opposite directions) relative to the frame in which the object has
no speed in the x direction. By symmetry, therefore, the y speed of the object must
be the same in your frame and in the lab frame.

11.14. Relative speed

Consider the frame S(cid:16) that travels along with the point P midway between the
particles. S(cid:16) moves at speed v cos θ , so the γ factor relating it to the lab frame is

Let the velocity of A point in the x direction, as shown in Fig. 11.56. Let S(cid:16) be the lab
frame, and let S be A’s frame (so frame S(cid:16) moves at velocity −u with respect to S). The
x and y speeds of B in frame S(cid:16) are v cos θ and v sin θ . Therefore, the longitudinal and

11.16. Transverse velocity addition

√

Assume that a clock on the particle shows a time T between successive passes of the
dotted lines. In frame S(cid:16), the speed of the particle is u(cid:16), so the time-dilation factor is
γ (cid:16) = 1/
1 − u(cid:16)2. The time between successive passes of the dotted lines is therefore
TS(cid:16) = γ (cid:16)T .

In frame S, the speed of the particle is

v2 + u2. (Yes, the Pythagorean theo-
rem holds for these speeds, because both speeds are measured with respect to the
1 − v2 − u2. The time

Remark: A slightly quicker method is the following. Imagine a clock at rest in S(cid:16),
with the same x(cid:16) value as the particle. Let this clock tick simultaneously (as seen
in S(cid:16)) with the particle’s crossings of the dotted lines. Then the clock also ticks
simultaneously with the particle’s crossings of the dotted lines in S, because the
clock and the particle have the same x(cid:16) values. But the clock ticks slower in S by a
1 − v2. Therefore, the y speed is smaller in S by this factor, as we wanted

in agreement with the velocity-addition formula.

Let’s now prove the formula for general N . We will use induction. That is, we will
assume that the result holds for N and then show that it holds for N + 1. To find the
speed, β(N +1), of the object with respect to SN +1, we can relativistically add the speed
of the object with respect to SN (which is β(N )) with the speed of SN with respect to
SN +1 (which is βN +1). This gives

β(N +1) =

Let β equal a dt/c, which is the relative speed of two frames at nearby times in the
spaceship scenario leading up to Eq. (11.64). If we let N = t/dt be the number of
frames (and if we take the limit dt → 0), then we have reproduced the spaceship
scenario. Therefore, the β(N ) in Eq. (11.108) should equal the v(t) in Eq. (11.64).
And indeed, with β = a dt/c and N = t/dt, Eq. (11.108) gives β(N ) = tanh(at/c),
as desired. ♣

11.18. Velocity addition from scratch

As stated in the problem, we will use the fact that the meeting of the photon and
the ball occurs at the same fraction of the way along the train, independent of the
frame. This is true because although distances may change depending on the frame,
fractions remain the same, because length contraction doesn’t depend on position.
We’ll compute the desired fraction in the train frame S(cid:16), and then in the ground
frame S.
Train frame: Let the train have length L(cid:16) in the train frame. Let’s first find the time
at which the photon meets the ball (see Fig. 11.57). From the figure, we see that the
sum of the distances traveled by the ball and the photon, which is v1t(cid:16) + ct(cid:16), must
equal twice the length of the train, which is 2L(cid:16). The time of the meeting is therefore
(cid:16) = 2L(cid:16)

The distance the ball has traveled is then v1t(cid:16) = 2v1L(cid:16)/(c + v1), and the desired
fraction F (cid:16) is

F

(cid:16) = 2v1
c + v1

.

(11.110)

Ground frame: Let the speed of the ball with respect to the ground be v, and let the
train have length L in the ground frame (L equals L(cid:16)/γ , but we’re not going to use
this). Again, let’s first find the time at which the photon meets the ball (see Fig. 11.58).
Light takes a time L/(c − v2) to reach the mirror, because the mirror is receding at
speed v2. At this time, the light has traveled a distance cL/(c − v2). From the figure,
we see that we can use the same reasoning as in the train-frame case, but now with the
sum of the distances traveled by the ball and the photon, which is vt + ct, equaling
2cL/(c − v2). The time of the meeting is therefore

L
(start)

(later)

(finish)

t =

2cL
(c − v2)(c + v) .

(11.111)

Fig. 11.58

The relative speed of the ball and the back of the train (as viewed in the ground frame)
is v − v2, so the distance between the ball and the back of the train at this time is
2(v − v2)cL/[(c − v2)(c + v)]. The desired fraction F is therefore

F = 2(v − v2)c
We can now equate the above expressions for F (cid:16) and F. For convenience, define

(c − v2)(c + v) .

(a) In A’s reference frame, the worldlines of A, B, and C are shown in Fig. 11.59.
B’s clock runs slow by a factor 1/γ . Therefore, if A’s clock reads t when B
meets C, then B’s clock reads t/γ when he meets C. So the time he gives to C
is t/γ .

In A’s reference frame, the time between this event and the event where C
meets A is again t, because B and C travel at the same speed. But A sees C’s
clock run slow by a factor 1/γ , so A sees C’s clock increase by t/γ . Therefore,
when A and C meet, A’s clock reads 2t, and C’s clock reads 2t/γ . In other
words, TC = TA/γ .

(b) Let’s now look at things in B’s frame. The worldlines of A, B, and C are shown
in Fig. 11.60. From B’s point of view, there are two competing effects that lead
to the relation TC = TA/γ . The first is that B sees A’s clock run slow, so the
time he hands off to C is larger than the time A’s clock reads at this moment.
The second effect is that from this point on, B sees C’s clock run slower than
A’s (because the relative speed of C and B is greater than the relative speed of
A and B). It turns out that this slowness wins out over the head start that C’s
clock had over A’s. So in the end, C’s clock reads a smaller time than A’s. Let’s
be quantitative about this.

Let B’s clock read tB when he meets C. Then when B hands off this time to
C, A’s clock reads only tB/γ . We’ll find all relevant times below in terms of
tB. We must determine how much additional time elapses on A’s clock and C’s
clock, by the time they meet. From the velocity-addition formula, B sees C
move to the left at speed 2v/(1 + v2). He also sees A move to the left at speed
v. But A had a head start of vtB in front of C, so if t is the time (as viewed from
B) between the meeting of B and C and the meeting of A and C, then

(c) Let’s now work in C’s frame. The worldlines of A, B, and C are shown in
Fig. 11.61. As in part (b), the relative speed of B and C is 2v/(1 + v2), and the
time-dilation factor between B and C is (1 + v2)/(1 − v2). Also, as in part (b),
let B and C meet when B’s clock reads tB. So this is the time that B hands off
to C. We’ll find all relevant times below in terms of tB.

11.13 Solutions

577

C sees B’s clock running slow, so from C’s point of view, B travels for a time
tB(1 + v2)/(1 − v2) after his meeting with A. In this time, B covers a distance

d to reach C is d/v = 2tB/(1 − v2). But since C sees A’s clock running slow
by a factor

1 − v2, A’s clock will read only

TA =

(11.120)

Now let’s find TC. To find TC, we must take tB and add to it the extra time it
takes A to reach C, compared with the time it takes B to reach C. From above,
this extra time is 2tB/(1 − v2) − tB(1 + v2)/(1 − v2) = tB. Therefore, C’s clock
reads

TC = 2tB.

Hence, TC = TA

leads to (cid:16)t = γ (cid:16)t(cid:16) only
Lorentz transformation (cid:16)t = γ
if (cid:16)x(cid:16) = 0. In this problem, the “ball leaving the back” and “ball hitting the
front” events happen at the same place in the ball frame, but in neither the
train frame nor the ground frame. Equivalently, neither the train frame nor the
ground frame is any more special than the other, as far as these two events go.
So if someone insisted on trying to use time dilation, he would have a hard time
deciding which side of the equation the γ should go on.

11.21. A new frame

First solution: Consider the Minkowski diagram in Fig. 11.62. In frame S, Event
1 is at the origin, and Event 2 is at the point (2, 1). Consider now the frame S(cid:16) whose
x(cid:16) axis passes through the point (2, 1). Since all points on the x(cid:16) axis are simultaneous
in the frame S(cid:16) (they all have t(cid:16) = 0), we see that S(cid:16) is the desired frame. From
Eq. (11.47), the slope of the x(cid:16) axis equals β ≡ v/c. Since the slope is 1/2, we have
v = c/2. Note that by looking at our Minkowski diagram, it is clear that if the relative
speed of S and S(cid:16) is greater than c/2, then Event 2 occurs before Event 1 in S(cid:16). And
if it is less than c/2, then Event 2 occurs after Event 1 in S(cid:16).
Second solution: Let the original frame be S, and let the desired frame be S(cid:16). Let
S(cid:16) move at speed v (in the positive direction) with respect to S. Our goal is to find v.
The Lorentz transformations from S to S(cid:16) are
(cid:16) = γ ((cid:16)x − v(cid:16)t), (cid:16)t

(11.128)
We want to make (cid:16)t(cid:16) equal to zero, so the second of these equations yields (cid:16)t −
v (cid:16)x/c2 = 0, or v = c2(cid:16)t/(cid:16)x. We are given (cid:16)x = 2 and (cid:16)t = 1/c, so the desired
v is c/2.

(cid:16) = γ ((cid:16)t − v (cid:16)x/c2).

the right event happens at x = 2, ct = 3/2. If we want, we can shift our clocks by
−1/(2c) in order to make the events happen at ct = 0 and ct = 1, but this shift is
irrelevant because all we are concerned with is differences in time.

Now consider an observer moving to the right at speed v. She sees the apparatus
moving to the left at speed v (see Fig. 11.64). Our goal is to find the v for which the
photons hit the receivers at the same time in her frame. Consider the photons moving
to the left. She sees them moving at speed c, but the left-hand receiver is receding at
speed v. So the relative speed (as measured by her) of the photons and the left-hand
receiver is c − v. By similar reasoning, the relative speed of the photons and the
right-hand receiver is c + v. The light source is three times as far from the right-hand
receiver as it is from the left-hand receiver. Therefore, if the light is to reach the two
receivers at the same time, we must have c + v = 3(c − v). This gives v = c/2.

11.22. Minkowski diagram units

All points on the ct(cid:16) axis have the property that x(cid:16) = 0. All points on the hyperbola
have the property that c2t(cid:16)2 − x(cid:16)2 = 1, due to the invariance of s2. So the ct(cid:16) value at
the intersection point A equals 1. Therefore, we simply have to determine the distance
on the paper from A to the origin (see Fig. 11.65). We’ll do this by finding the (x, ct)
coordinates of A. We know that tan θ = β. But tan θ = x/ct. Therefore, x = β(ct)
(which is just the statement that x = vt). Plugging this into the given information,
c2t2 − x2 = 1, we find ct = 1/

1 − β2. The distance from A to the origin is then

This quantity is therefore the ratio of the unit sizes on the ct(cid:16) and ct axes, in agreement
with Eq. (11.46). Exactly the same analysis holds for the x-axis unit size ratio.

11.23. Velocity addition via Minkowski

Pick a point P on the object’s worldline. Let the coordinates of P in frame S be (x, ct).
Our goal is to find the speed u = x/t. Throughout this problem, it will be easier to
work with the quantities β ≡ v/c, so our goal is then to find βu ≡ x/(ct).

The coordinates of P in S(cid:16), namely (x(cid:16), ct(cid:16)), are indicated by the parallelogram in
Fig. 11.66. For convenience, let ct(cid:16) have length a on the paper. Then from the given
information, we have x(cid:16) = v1t(cid:16) ≡ β1(ct(cid:16)) = β1a. This is the distance from A to P
on the paper. In terms of a, we can now determine the coordinates (x, ct) of P. The
coordinates of point A are

(x, ct)A = (a sin θ, a cos θ ).

(11.130)

The coordinates of P, relative to A, are

(x, ct)P−A = (β1a cos θ, β1a sin θ ).

(11.131)

Adding these two sets of coordinates gives the coordinates of point P as

(x, ct)P = (a sin θ + β1a cos θ, a cos θ + β1a sin θ ).

(11.132)

The ratio of x to ct at the point P is therefore

βu ≡ x
ct

= sin θ + β1 cos θ
cos θ + β1 sin θ

= tan θ + β1
1 + β1 tan θ

=

β2 + β1

(11.133)

where we have used tan θ = v2/c ≡ β2, because S(cid:16) moves at speed v2 with respect
to S. If we change from the β’s back to the v’s, the result is u = (v2+v1)/(1+v1v2/c2),
as expected.

11.24. Clapping both ways

(a) From the usual time-dilation result, A sees B’s clock run slow, so B must clap
his hands at time intervals of (cid:16)t/γ in order for the intervals to be (cid:16)t in A’s
frame. The relevant Minkowski diagram is shown in Fig. 11.67. Let B clap at
the spacetime locations where the horizontal lines (lines of simultaneity in A’s
frame) intersect B’s worldline. From the given information, the vertical spacing
between the lines is c (cid:16)t. Therefore, the spacing along B’s tilted worldline
1 + β2 c (cid:16)t. But we know from Eq. (11.46)
(which has a slope of ±1/β) is
(1 + β2)/(1 − β2) times the
that the unit size of B’s ct axis on the paper is
unit size of A’s ct axis. Therefore, the time interval between claps in B’s frame is

as above.

(b) From the usual time-dilation result, B sees A’s clock run slow, so A must
clap his hands at time intervals of (cid:16)t/γ in order for the intervals to be (cid:16)t in
B’s frame. However, B can invoke this standard time-dilation reasoning only
during the parts of the trip where he is in an inertial frame. That is, he cannot
invoke it during the turnaround period. We therefore have the situation shown
in Fig. 11.68. Let A clap at the spacetime locations where the tilted lines (lines of
simultaneity in B’s frame) intersect A’s worldline. From the given information,
the tilted spacing between the lines along B’s worldline is c (cid:16)t time units, which
(1 + β2)/(1 − β2) c (cid:16)t on the paper. But then by the same type
has a length
of geometry reasoning that led to Eq. (11.49), the vertical spacing between the
1 − β2 c (cid:16)t, which gives
lines along A’s worldline is (as you should verify)
a time interval of (cid:16)t/γ , as above.

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

But the critical point here is that since the slope of the tilted lines abruptly
changes when B turns around, there is a large interval of time in the middle
of A’s worldline where the tilted lines don’t hit it. The result is that A claps
frequently for a while, then doesn’t clap at all for a while, then claps frequently
again. The overall result, as we will now show, is that more time elapses in
A’s frame (it will turn out to be 2L/v, of course, where L is the distance in
A’s frame to the star) than in B’s frame (2L/γ v, from the usual time-dilation
result).

Since the time between claps is shorter in A’s frame than in B’s frame (except
in the middle region), the time elapsed on A’s clock while he is clapping is 1/γ
times the total time elapsed on B’s clock, which gives (2L/γ v)/γ = 2L/γ 2v.
But as shown in Fig. 11.68, the length of the region on A’s ct axis where there
is no clapping is 2βL, which corresponds to a time of 2vL/c2. The total time
elapsed on A’s clock during the entire process is therefore

There are various ways to solve this problem, for example, by sending photons
between the people, or by invoking the Equivalence Principle in General Relativity.
We’ll do it here by using a Minkowski diagram, to demonstrate that this redshift result
can be derived perfectly fine using only basic Special Relativity.

Draw the world lines of the two people, A and B, as seen by an observer, C, in the
frame where they were both initially at rest. We have the situation shown in Fig. 11.69.
Consider an infinitesimal time (cid:16)t, as measured by C. At this time (in C’s frame),

A and B are both moving at speed a(cid:16)t. The axes of the A frame are shown in Fig. 11.70.
Both A and B have moved a distance a((cid:16)t)2/2, which can be neglected because (cid:16)t
is small (it will turn out that the leading-order terms in the result are of order (cid:16)t,
so any ((cid:16)t)2 terms can be ignored.) Also, the special-relativistic time-dilation factor
between any of the A, B, C frames can be neglected, because the relative speeds are
at most v = a(cid:16)t, so the time-dilation factors differ from 1 by order ((cid:16)t)2. Let A
make a little explosion (call this event E1) at time (cid:16)t in C’s frame. Then (cid:16)t is also
the time of the explosion as measured by A, up to an error of order ((cid:16)t)2.

Let’s figure out where A’s x axis (that is, the “now” axis in A’s frame) meets B’s
worldline. The slope of A’s x axis in the figure is v/c = a (cid:16)t/c. So the axis starts at
a height c (cid:16)t, and then climbs up by the amount ad (cid:16)t/c, over the distance d (the
distance is indeed d, up to corrections of order ((cid:16)t)2). Therefore, the axis meets B’s
worldline at a height c (cid:16)t + ad (cid:16)t/c as viewed by C, that is, at a time (cid:16)t + ad (cid:16)t/c2,
as viewed by C. But C’s time is the same as B’s time (up to order ((cid:16)t)2), so B’s clock
reads (cid:16)t(1 + ad/c2). Let’s say that B makes a little explosion (event E2) at this time.
Events E1 and E2 both occur at the same time in A’s frame, because they both lie
along a line of constant time in A’s frame. This means that in A’s frame, B’s clock
reads (cid:16)t(1 + ad/c2) when A’s clock reads (cid:16)t. Therefore, in A’s (changing) frame,
B’s clock is sped up by a factor,

(cid:16)tB
(cid:16)tA

= 1 + ad
c2 .

(11.136)

We can perform the same procedure to see how A’s clock behaves in B’s frame.
Drawing B’s x axis at time (cid:16)t, we quickly find that in B’s (changing) frame, A’s clock
is slowed down by a factor,

= 1 − ad
c2 .
We’ll see much more of these results in Chapter 14.

(cid:16)tA
(cid:16)tB

Remarks:

(11.137)

1. In the usual Special Relativity situation where two observers fly past each other
with relative speed v, they both see the other person’s time slowed down by
the same factor. This had better be the case, because the situation is symmetric
between the observers. But in this problem, A sees B’s clock sped up, and B sees
A’s clock slowed down. This difference is possible because the situation is not
symmetric between A and B. The acceleration vector determines a direction in
space, and one person (namely B) is farther along this direction than the other
person.

2. Another derivation of this ad/c2 result is the following. Consider the setup a
short time after the start. An outside observer sees A’s and B’s clocks showing
the same time. Therefore, by the usual vd/c2 rear-clock-ahead result in Special
Relativity, B’s clock must read vd/c2 more than A’s, in the moving frame. The
increase per unit time, as viewed by A, is therefore (vd/c2)/t = ad/c2. Note that
any special-relativistic time-dilation or length-contraction effects are of second
order in v/c, and hence negligible since v is small here. At any later time, we
can repeat (roughly) this derivation in the instantaneous rest frame of A. ♣

11.26. Break or not break?

There are two possible reasonings, so we seem to have a paradox:

• To an observer in the original rest frame, the spaceships stay the same distance d
apart. Therefore, in the frame of the spaceships, the distance between them, d(cid:16),
must equal γ d. This is true because d(cid:16) is the distance that gets length-contracted
down to d. After a long enough time, γ will differ appreciably from 1, so the
string will be stretched by a large factor. Therefore, it will break.

• Let A be the rear spaceship, and let B be the front spaceship. From A’s point of
view, it looks like B is doing exactly what he is doing (and vice versa). A says
that B has the same acceleration that he has. So B should stay the same distance
ahead of him. Therefore, the string shouldn’t break.

The first reasoning is correct (or mostly correct; see the first remark below). The
string will break. So that’s the answer to our problem. But as with any good relativ-
ity paradox, we shouldn’t feel at ease until we’ve explained what’s wrong with the
incorrect reasoning.

The problem with the second reasoning is that A does not see B doing exactly what
he is doing. Rather, we know from Problem 11.25 that A sees B’s clock running fast
(and B sees A’s clock running slow). A therefore sees B’s engine running faster, and
so B pulls away from A. Therefore, the string eventually breaks.44

Things become more clear if we draw a Minkowski diagram. Figure 11.71 shows
the x(cid:16) and ct(cid:16) axes of A’s frame. The x(cid:16) axis is tilted up, so it meets B’s worldline
farther to the right than you might think. The distance PQ along the x(cid:16) axis is the
distance that A measures the string to be. Although it isn’t obvious that this distance
in A’s frame is larger than d (because the unit size on the x(cid:16) axis is larger than that
in the original frame), we can demonstrate this as follows. In A’s frame, the distance
PQ is greater than the distance PQ(cid:16). But PQ(cid:16) is simply the length of something in A’s
frame that has length d in the original frame. So PQ(cid:16) is γ d in A’s frame. And since
PQ > γ d > d in A’s frame, the string breaks.

Remarks:

1. There is one slight (inconsequential) flaw in the first reasoning above.
There isn’t one “frame of the spaceships.” Their frames differ, because
they measure a relative speed between themselves. Therefore, it isn’t clear
exactly what is meant by the “length” of the string, because it isn’t clear
what frame the measurement should take place in. This ambiguity, how-
ever, does not change the fact that A and B observe their separation to be
(roughly) γ d.

If we want there to eventually be a well-defined “frame of the spaceships,”
we can modify the problem by stating that after a while the spaceships stop
accelerating simultaneously, as measured by someone in the original inertial
frame. Equivalently, A and B turn off their engines after equal proper times.
What A sees is the following. B pulls away from A. B then turns off his engine.
The gap continues to widen. But A continues to fire his engine until be reaches
B’s speed. They then sail onward, in a common frame, keeping a constant
separation (which is greater than the original separation, by a factor γ ).

2. The main issue in this problem is that it depends on exactly how we choose to
accelerate an extended object. If we accelerate a stick by pushing on the back
end (or by pulling on the front end), its length will remain essentially the same
in its own frame, and it will become shorter in the original frame. But if we
arrange for each end (or perhaps a number of points on the stick) to speed up in
such a way that they always move at the same speed with respect to the original
frame, then the stick will be torn apart.

3. This problem gives the key to the classic problem of the relativistic wagon
wheel, which can be stated as follows (you may want to cover up the following
paragraph, so you can solve the problem on your own). A wheel is spun faster

44 This also follows from the Equivalence Principle and the general-relativistic time-dilation effect
which we’ll discuss in Chapter 14. Since A and B are accelerating, they may be considered (by
the Equivalence Principle) to be in a gravitational field, with B “higher” in the field. But high
clocks run fast in a gravitational field. Therefore, A sees B’s clock running fast (and B sees A’s
clock running slow).

and faster, until the points on the rim move at a relativistic speed. In the lab
frame, the circumference is length contracted, but the spokes aren’t (because
they always lie perpendicular to the direction of motion). So if the rim has length
2πr in the lab frame, then it has length 2πγ r in the wheel frame. Therefore, in
the wheel frame, the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is larger than π.
So the question is: Is this really true? And if so, how does the circumference
become longer in the wheel frame?

I’m putting this sentence here just in case you happened to see the first sentence
of this paragraph as you were trying to cover it up and solve the problem on
your own; it should probably even be a little longer, maybe like … this. The
answer is that it is indeed true. If we imagine little rocket engines placed around
the rim, and if we have them all accelerate with the same proper acceleration,
then from the above results, the separation between the engines will gradually
increase, thereby increasing the length of the circumference. Assuming that
the material in the rim can’t stretch indefinitely, the rim will eventually break
between each engine. In the rotating (and hence accelerating) wheel frame,
the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is indeed larger than π. In other
words, space is curved in the wheel frame. This is consistent with the facts that
(1) the Equivalence Principle (discussed in Chapter 14) states that acceleration
is equivalent to gravity, and (2) gravitational fields in General Relativity are
associated with curved space. ♣

It isn’t necessary, of course, to use matrices in this problem, but things look nicer if

Chapter 12
Relativity (Dynamics)

In the previous chapter, we dealt only with abstract particles flying through
space and time. We didn’t concern ourselves with the nature of the particles,
how they got to be moving, or what would happen if various particles interacted.
In this chapter we will deal with these issues. That is, we will discuss masses,
forces, energy, momentum, etc. The two main results of this chapter are that the
momentum and energy of a particle are given by

p = γ mv,

and E = γ mc2,

(12.1)

(cid:4)

1 − v2/c2, and m is the mass of the particle.1 When v (cid:4) c, the
where γ ≡ 1/
expression for p reduces to p = mv, as it should for a nonrelativistic particle.
When v = 0, the expression for E reduces to the well-known E = mc2.

12.1 Energy and momentum

In this section, we’ll give some justification for Eqs. (12.1). The reasoning
here should convince you of their truth. An alternative, and perhaps more con-
vincing, motivation comes from the 4-vector formalism in Chapter 13. In the
end, however, the justification for Eqs. (12.1) is obtained through experiments.
And indeed, experiments in high-energy accelerators are continually verifying
the truth of these expressions. (More precisely, they are verifying that these
energy and momenta are conserved in any type of collision.) We therefore con-
clude, with reasonable certainty, that Eqs. (12.1) give the correct expressions
for energy and momentum. But actual experiments aside, let’s consider a few
thought-experiments that motivate the above expressions.

12.1.1 Momentum

Consider the following system. In the lab frame, identical particles A and B move
as shown in Fig. 12.1. They move with equal and opposite small speeds in the

1 There are various ways that people use the word “mass” in relativity. In particular, some
people talk about “rest mass” and “relativistic mass.” But we won’t use these terms. We’ll use
“mass” to refer only to what other people would call “rest mass.” See the discussion on page 590
for more on this.

x direction, and with equal and opposite large speeds in the y direction. Their
paths are arranged so that they glance off each other and reverse their motion in
the x direction. Imagine a series of equally spaced vertical lines for reference.
Assume that A and B have identical clocks that tick every time they cross one of
these lines.

Consider now the reference frame that moves in the y direction with the same
vy as A. In this frame, the situation is shown in Fig. 12.2. The collision simply
changes the sign of the x velocities of the particles. Therefore, the x momenta
of the two particles must be the same. This is true because if, say, A’s px were
larger than B’s px, then the total px would point to the right before the collision,
and to the left after the collision. Since momentum is something we want to be
conserved, this cannot be the case.

(cid:4)

However, the x speeds of the two particles are not the same in this frame.
A is essentially at rest in this frame, and B is moving with a very large speed,
v. Therefore, B’s clock is running slower than A’s, by a factor essentially equal
to 1/γ ≡
1 − v2/c2. And since B’s clock ticks once for every vertical line it
crosses (this fact is independent of the frame), B must therefore be moving slower
in the x direction, by a factor of 1/γ . Therefore, the Newtonian expression,
px = mvx, cannot be the correct one for momentum, because B’s momentum
would be smaller than A’s (by a factor of 1/γ ), due to their different vx’s. But
the γ factor in

px = γ mvx ≡

(cid:4)

mvx
1 − v2/c2

precisely takes care of this problem, because γ ≈ 1 for A, and γ = 1/
for B, which cancels the effect of B’s smaller vx.

To obtain the three-dimensional form of p, we can use the fact that the vector
p must point in the same direction as the vector v, because any other direction
for p would violate rotation invariance. If someone claims that p points in the
direction shown in Fig. 12.3, then he would be hard-pressed to explain why it
doesn’t instead point along the direction p(cid:16) shown. In short, the direction of v
is the only preferred direction in space. Therefore, Eq. (12.2) implies that the
momentum vector must be

The above setup is only one specific type of collision among an infinite
number of possible types of collisions. What we’ve shown with this setup is that
the only possible vector of the form f (v)mv (where f is some function) that has

586

Relativity (Dynamics)

any chance at being conserved in all collisions is γ mv (or some constant multiple
of this). We haven’t proved that it actually is conserved in all collisions. This is
where the gathering of data from experiments comes in. But we’ve shown above
that it would be a waste of time to consider, for example, the vector γ 5mv.

12.1.2 Energy
Having given some justification for the momentum expression, p = γ mv, let’s
now try to justify the energy expression,

E = γ mc2.

(12.4)

More precisely, we’ll show that the above form of the momentum implies that
γ mc2 is conserved in interactions (or at least in the specific interaction below).
There are various ways to do this. The best way, perhaps, is to use the 4-vector
formalism in Chapter 13. But we’ll study one simple setup here that should
do the job.

Consider the following system. Two identical particles of mass m head toward
each other, both with speed u, as shown in Fig. 12.4. They stick together and
form a particle of mass M . M is at rest, due to the symmetry of the situation. At
the moment we can’t assume anything about the size of M , but we’ll find below
that it does not equal the naive value of 2m. This setup is a fairly uninteresting
one (conservation of momentum gives 0 = 0), so let’s instead consider the less
trivial view of it in the frame moving to the left at speed u. This situation is
shown in Fig. 12.5. The right mass is at rest, the left mass moves to the right at
speed v = 2u/(1 + u2) from the velocity-addition formula,2 and the final mass M
moves to the right at speed u. Note that the γ factor associated with the speed v is

Conservation of momentum therefore tells us that M does not equal 2m. But if u
is very small, then M is approximately equal to 2m, as we know from everyday
experience.

2 We’re going to set c = 1 for a little while here, because this calculation would get a bit messy if
we kept in the c’s. We’ll discuss the issue of setting c = 1 in more detail at the end of this section.

12.1 Energy and momentum

Using the value of M from Eq. (12.6), let’s now check that our candidate for
energy, E = γ mc2, is conserved in this collision. There is no freedom left in any
of the parameters, so γ mc2 is either conserved or it isn’t. In the original frame
where M is at rest, E is conserved if

which is indeed true. Let’s also check that E is conserved in the frame where

(12.8)

which is indeed true. So E is also conserved in this frame. This example should
convince you that γ mc2 is at least a believable expression for the energy of a
particle. But just as in the case of momentum, we haven’t proved that γ mc2
actually is conserved in all collisions. This is the duty of experiments. But
we’ve shown that it would be a waste of time to consider, for example, the
quantity γ 4mc2.

One thing that we certainly need to check is that if E and p are conserved in
one reference frame, then they are conserved in any other. We’ll demonstrate this
in Section 12.2. A conservation law shouldn’t depend on what frame you’re in,
after all.

Remarks:

1. As mentioned above, we’re technically not trying to justify Eqs. (12.1) here. These two
equations by themselves are devoid of any meaning. All they do is define the letters p and
E. Our goal is to make a meaningful physical statement, not just a definition.

The meaningful physical statement that we want to make is that the quantities γ mv
and γ mc2 are conserved in an interaction among particles (and this is what we tried to
justify above). This fact then makes these quantities worthy of special attention, because
conserved quantities are very helpful in understanding what is happening in a given
physical situation. And anything worthy of special attention certainly deserves a label,
so we may then attach the names “momentum” and “energy” to γ mv and γ mc2. Any
other names would work just as well, of course, but we choose these because in the limit
of small speeds, γ mv and γ mc2 reduce (as we will soon show) to some other nicely
conserved quantities, which someone already tagged with the labels “momentum” and
“energy” long ago.

2. As we’ve noted, the fact of the matter is that we can’t prove that γ mv and γ mc2 are
conserved. In Newtonian physics, conservation of p ≡ mv is basically postulated by
Newton’s third law, and we’re not going to be able to do any better than that here. All we
can hope to do as physicists is provide some motivation for considering γ mv and γ mc2,
then show that it is consistent for γ mv and γ mc2 to be conserved during an interaction,
and then gather a large amount of experimental evidence, all of which is consistent with

588

Relativity (Dynamics)

γ mv and γ mc2 being conserved. As far as the experimental evidence goes, suffice it to
say that high-energy accelerators, cosmological observations, and many other forums are
continually verifying everything that we think is true about relativistic dynamics. If the
theory isn’t correct, then we know that it must be the limiting case of a more correct
theory.3 But all this experimental induction has to count for something …

“To three, five, and seven, assign
A name,” the prof said, “We’ll define.”
But he botched the instruction
With woeful induction
And told us the next prime was nine.

3. Conservation of energy in relativistic mechanics is actually a much simpler con-
cept than in nonrelativistic mechanics, because E = γ m is conserved, period. We
don’t have to worry about the generation of internal energy (heat or internal poten-
tial energy), which ruins conservation of the nonrelativistic E = mv2/2. The internal
energy is simply built into the total energy. In the above example, the two m’s col-
lide and generate internal energy (heat) in the resulting mass M . This internal energy
shows up as an increase in mass, which makes M larger than 2m. The energy that
corresponds to the increase in mass comes from the initial kinetic energy of the
two m’s.

4. Problem 12.1 gives an alternate derivation of the energy and momentum expressions in
Eq. (12.1). This derivation uses additional facts, namely that the energy and momentum
of a photon are given by E = hν and p = hν/c, where ν is the frequency of the light, and
h is Planck’s constant. ♣

Any multiple of γ mc2 is also conserved, of course. Why did we pick γ mc2 to
label as “E” instead of, say, 5γ mc3? Consider the approximate form that γ mc2
takes in the Newtonian limit, that is, in the limit v (cid:4) c. We have, using the
Taylor series expansion for (1 − x)−1/2,

E ≡ γ mc2 =

(cid:4)

(12.9)

The dots represent higher-order terms in v2/c2, which may be neglected if v (cid:4) c.
In an elastic collision in Newtonian physics, no heat is generated, so mass is
conserved. That is, the quantity mc2 has a fixed value. We therefore see that
conservation of E ≡ γ mc2 reduces to the familiar conservation of Newtonian
kinetic energy, mv2/2, for elastic collisions in the limit of slow speeds. This is an
example of the correspondence principle, which says that relativistic formulas
must reduce to the familiar nonrelativistic ones in the nonrelativistic limit. Like-
wise, for the momentum we picked p ≡ γ mv instead of, say, 6γ mc4v, because

3 And in fact it isn’t correct, because it doesn’t incorporate quantum mechanics. The more complete

theory that includes both relativity and quantum mechanics is quantum field theory.

12.1 Energy and momentum

589

the former reduces to the familiar Newtonian momentum, mv, in the limit of slow
speeds.

Whether abstract, profound, or just mystic,
Or boring, or somewhat simplistic,
A theory must lead
To results that we need
In limits, nonrelativistic.

Whenever we use the term “energy,” we will mean the total energy, γ mc2. If
we use the term “kinetic energy,” we will mean a particle’s excess energy over
the energy it has when it is motionless. In other words, the kinetic energy is
γ mc2 − mc2. Kinetic energy is not necessarily conserved in a collision, because
mass is not necessarily conserved, as we saw in Eq. (12.6) in the above example.
In the CM frame, there was kinetic energy before the collision, but none after.
Kinetic energy is a rather artificial concept in relativity. You virtually always
want to use the total energy, γ mc2, when solving a problem.

Note the following important relation,

E2 − |p|2c2 = γ 2m2c4 − γ 2m2|v|2c2

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(12.10)

This is a primary ingredient in solving relativistic collision problems, as we’ll
soon see. It replaces the K = p2/2m relation between kinetic energy and momen-
tum in Newtonian physics. It can be derived in more profound ways, as we’ll see
in Chapter 13. It’s so important that I like to call it the Very Important Relation.
Let’s put it in a box:

E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 .

(12.11)

Whenever you know two of the three quantities E, p, and m, this equation gives
you the third. In the case where m = 0 (as with photons), Eq. (12.11) says that

E = pc

(for photons).

(12.12)

This is the key equation for massless objects. For photons, the two equations,
p = γ mv and E = γ mc2, don’t tell us much, because m = 0 and γ = ∞,
so their product is undetermined. But E2 − |p|2c2 = m2c4 still holds, and we
conclude that E = pc. Note that any massless particle must have γ = ∞. That
is, it must travel at speed c. If this weren’t the case, then E = γ mc2 would equal
zero, in which case the particle wouldn’t be much of a particle. We’d have a hard
time observing something with no energy.

590

Relativity (Dynamics)

Another nice relation, which follows from Eqs. (12.1) and holds for particles

of any mass, is

p
E

(12.13)

Given p and E, this is definitely the quickest way to get v.

The general size of mc 2
What is the general size of mc2? 4 If we let m = 1 kg, then we have mc2 =
(1 kg)(3 · 108 m/s)2 ≈ 1017 J. How big is this? A typical household electric
bill might be around $50 per month, or $600 per year. At about 10 cents per
kilowatt-hour, this translates to 6000 kilowatt-hours per year. Since there are
3600 seconds in an hour, this converts to (6000)(103)(3600) ≈ 2 · 1010 watt-
seconds. That is, 2 · 1010 joules per year. We therefore see that if one kilogram
were converted completely into usable energy (that is, kinetic energy, which can
then be used to drive a turbine), it would be enough to provide electricity to about
1017/(2 · 1010), or 5 million, homes for a year. That’s a lot.

In a nuclear reactor, only a small fraction of the mass is converted into usable
energy (heat). Most of the mass remains in the final products, which doesn’t help
in lighting your home. If a particle were to combine with its antiparticle, then it
would be possible for all of the mass energy to be converted into usable energy.
But we’re a while away from being able to do this productively. However, even a
small fraction of the very large quantity, E = mc2, can be large, as evidenced by
the use of nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Any quantity with a few factors
of c is bound to change the face of the world.

Mass
Some treatments of relativity use the term “rest mass,” m0, to refer to the mass of
a motionless particle, and “relativistic mass,” mrel, to refer to the quantity γ m0 of
a moving particle. We won’t use this terminology here. The only thing we’ll call
“mass” is what the above treatments call “rest mass.” (For example, the mass of
an electron is 9.11 · 10−31 kg, and the mass of a liter of water is 1 kg, independent
of their speed.) And since we’ll refer to only one type of mass, there is no need
to use the qualifier “rest” or the subscript “0.” We’ll therefore simply use the
notation “m.”

Of course, you can define the quantity γ m to be anything you want. There’s
nothing wrong with calling it “relativistic mass.” But the point is that γ m already
goes by another name. It’s just the energy, up to factors of c. The use of the word
“mass” for this quantity, although quite permissible, is certainly not needed.

Furthermore, the word “mass” is used to describe what is on the right-hand
side of the equation, E2 − |p|2c2 = m2. The m2 here is an invariant, that is,

4 See Fadner (1988) for a history of the mass–energy relation.

12.1 Energy and momentum

591

it is something that is independent of the frame of reference. Although E and
p depend on the frame because they involve v, this v dependence cancels out
when taking the difference of their squares, yielding a frame-independent m2. If
“mass” is to be used in this definite way to describe an invariant, then it doesn’t
make sense to also use it to describe the quantity γ m, which is frame-dependent.
The prefixes “rest” and “relativistic” are introduced to avoid this problem, but
the result of this is just a watering down of the very important invariance quality
of “mass.”

However, since there is in fact nothing actually wrong with using “relativis-
tic mass,” it mainly comes down to personal preference whether or not you
like the term. Certainly one motivation for labeling γ m as some kind of mass
is that the expression for momentum looks like p = γ m0v ≡ mrelv, which mim-
ics the Newtonian expression. And the expression for energy takes the nice form,
E = γ m0c2 ≡ mrelc2. But considering that Newtonian physics is only a limiting
case of relativistic physics, it is questionable what is gained by molding a theory
that is more correct into one that is less correct. At any rate, my view is that
these nice formulas don’t outweigh the usefulness of having the word “mass”
mean a very specific invariant quantity, with the word “energy” referring to the
frame-dependent quantity γ m. Invariant quantities have a certain sacred place
in physics, so they should be given a name that doesn’t have any noninvariant
connotations.

Lagrangian method
Another way to motivate the above expressions for E and p is to use the
Lagrangian method. To take this route, we must of course figure out what the
relativistic Lagrangian is. This might seem like a daunting task, considering that
the Lagrangians we dealt with in Chapter 6 involved the kinetic energy, and we
have no idea yet what the energy is here (that’s one of our goals, after all).

It turns out, however,

that it’s fairly easy to write down the relativistic
Lagrangian, provided that we think outside the “T − V ” box and concentrate
instead on the all-important fact that the action is something that is stationary
for the classical path. Combining this fact with the relativity postulate, which
states that there is no preferred reference frame, we see that the action must be
stationary in all frames. A sensible property to require of the action is therefore
that it be independent of the frame. This way, if it is stationary in one frame, then
it is stationary in any other.5

What invariant quantities do we know of? Well, there are certainly m and c.
But the more interesting one that we’re familiar with is the invariant interval (the
proper time), c dτ ≡
c2 dt2 − dx2. This is pretty much all we have to work

√

5 I suppose you could imagine a quantity that depends on the frame, but that is still stationary in
any frame. But clearly the simplest thing to try (which will in fact work) is something that is
independent of the frame.

S = −mc

c dτ = −mc

c2 dt2 − dx2 = −mc

c2 − ˙x2 dt.

(12.14)

We have put the mc out front to give S the usual units of energy times time. And
the minus sign (which doesn’t affect the stationary property) is included so that
we will obtain the correct signs for the energy and momentum. Our Lagrangian
is therefore

(cid:4)

L = −mc

c2 − ˙x2.

(12.15)

(12.16)

(12.17)

This is simply the momentum we defined earlier, which, in view of Eq. (12.16),
is conserved, as it should be. What about the energy? The energy associated with
our Lagrangian is given by (using Eq. (6.52))

which agrees with our earlier expression for E. We can also calculate the angular
momentum. In polar coordinates, the Lagrangian can be written as

(cid:15)

L = −mc

c2 − (˙r2 + r2 ˙θ 2).

(12.20)

The quantity in the parentheses, which we see is conserved, can be written
as γ mr2 ˙θ. Because it is associated with the angle θ, we call it the angular
momentum. And as expected, it reduces properly to the nonrelativistic result
when γ = 1.

12.1 Energy and momentum

593

Of course, this Lagrangian justification for E and p might seem a little silly,
because we’re just dealing with a free particle, and any quantity involving v is
conserved for a free particle. But the fact that the above E and p can be derived
from a Lagrangian involving an invariant quantity (which is the only nontrivial
invariant quantity we know of) gives them a reasonable amount of credence.

If we want to go beyond a free particle and incorporate a potential energy into
the system, things get more complicated; see Brehme (1971). The first thought
that comes to mind is to simply subtract off a potential V (x) in the Lagrangian,
as we did in the nonrelativistic case. We then have L = −mc
c2 − ˙x2 − V (x),
and the Euler–Lagrange equation becomes

(12.21)

(cid:17)

This is the correct F = dp/dt statement, so it seems that we picked the right
Lagrangian. However, there is something amiss here; the action now involves the
V (x) dt which isn’t invariant, because the time in one frame doesn’t
quantity
equal the time in another. Although the above Lagrangian does indeed yield
the correct equation of motion in the particular reference frame in which the
function V (x) is defined, if we switch to another frame there is no guarantee that
it will do so again. In order to maintain an invariant action, we must construct
it from 4-vectors (discussed in Chapter 13), or other tensors, multiplied in an
appropriate way. The classic system involving 4-vectors is a charged particle
in an electromagnetic field. Other systems involving more complicated tensors
occur in General Relativity. But we’re not going to get into any of that here,
because our goal was only to motivate the expressions for E and p. 6

Setting c = 1
For the remainder of our treatment of relativity, we will invariably work in units
where c = 1. For example, instead of one meter being the unit of distance, we
can make 3 · 108 meters equal to one unit. Or, we can keep the meter as is, and
make 1/(3 · 108) seconds the unit of time. In such units, our various expressions
become

p = γ mv, E = γ m, E2 = p2 + m2,

p
E

= v.

(12.22)

Said in another way, you can simply ignore all the c’s in your calculations (which
will generally save you a lot of strife), and then put them back into your final
answer to make the units correct. For example, let’s say the goal of a certain

6 In multiparticle systems, it turns out that in general it is impossible to create a consistent relativistic
Lagrangian formalism. The only way to proceed is to work in terms of fields instead of particles.
But this is well beyond the scope of what we’re doing here. See Goldstein et al. (2002).

594

Relativity (Dynamics)

problem is to find the time of some event. If your answer comes out to be (cid:2),
where (cid:2) is a given length, then you know that the correct answer (in terms of the
usual mks units) has to be (cid:2)/c, because this has units of time. In order for this
procedure to work, there must be only one way to put the c’s back in at the end.
This is always the case, because if there were two ways, then we would have
ca = cb, for some numbers a (cid:13)= b. But this is impossible, because c has units.

12.2 Transformations of E and p

Consider the following one-dimensional situation, where all the motion is along
the x axis. A particle has energy E(cid:16) and momentum p(cid:16) in frame S(cid:16). Frame S(cid:16) moves
at speed v with respect to frame S, in the positive x direction (see Fig. 12.6). What
are E and p in S?

Let u(cid:16) be the particle’s speed in S(cid:16). From the velocity-addition formula, the

particle’s speed in S is (dropping the factors of c)

u = u(cid:16) + v
1 + u(cid:16)v .

(12.23)

This is all we need to know, because a particle’s velocity determines its energy
and momentum. But we’ll need to go through a little algebra to make things look
nice and pretty. The γ factor associated with the speed u is

γu =

(cid:16)v).

(12.24)

The energy and momentum in S(cid:16) are

(cid:16) = γu(cid:16) m,

E

and

(cid:16) = γu(cid:16) mu

(cid:16)

,

p

(12.25)

while the energy and momentum in S are, using Eq. (12.24),

E = γum = γu(cid:16) γv(1 + u

(cid:16)v)m,

p = γumu = γu(cid:16) γv(1 + u

(cid:16)v)m

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

u(cid:16) + v
1 + u(cid:16)v

= γu(cid:16) γv(u

(cid:16) + v)m.

(12.26)

Using the E(cid:16) and p(cid:16) from Eqs. (12.25), we can rewrite E and p as (with γ ≡ γv)

E = γ (E
p = γ (p

(cid:16) + vp
(cid:16) + vE

(cid:16)),
(cid:16)).

(12.27)

These are transformations for E and p between frames. If you want to put the
factors of c back in, then the vE(cid:16) term becomes vE(cid:16)/c2, to make the units correct.
These transformations are easy to remember, because they look exactly like the

12.2 Transformations of E and p

595

Lorentz transformations for the coordinates t and x in Eq. (11.21). More precisely
with the c’s included, E and pc transform like ct and x, respectively.7 This is no
coincidence, as we will see in Chapter 13. As a check on Eqs. (12.27), if u(cid:16) = 0
(so that p(cid:16) = 0 and E(cid:16) = m), then E = γ m and p = γ mv, as expected. Also, if
u(cid:16) = −v (so that p(cid:16) = −γ mv and E(cid:16) = γ m), then E = m and p = 0, as expected.
Because the transformations in Eqs. (12.27) are linear, they also hold if E
and p represent the total energy and momentum of a collection of particles.

just as we showed that t2 −x2 = t(cid:16)2 −x(cid:16)2 in Eq. (11.40). The proof there was based
on the fact that t and x transform under the Lorentz transformations, so exactly
the same proof works here with E and p, in view of the Lorentz transformations
in Eqs. (12.27). The E’s and p’s in Eq. (12.29) can represent any (corresponding)
linear combinations of the E’s and p’s of the various particles (for example, the
total E and p of the particles), due to the linearity of Eqs. (12.27). For one particle,
we already know that Eq. (12.29) is true, because both sides are equal to m2, from
Eq. (12.10). For many particles, the invariant quantity E2
total equals the
square of the total energy in the CM frame (which reduces to m2 for one particle),
because ptotal = 0 in the CM frame, by definition.

reference frame during a collision, then they are conserved in any other frame (because
a conservation law shouldn’t depend on what frame you’re in). This can be shown as
follows. The total (cid:16)E is a linear combination of the initial and final E’s, and likewise for

7 Since the Lorentz transformations are symmetric in ct and x, and likewise in E and pc, it isn’t clear
which coordinate in one transformation corresponds to which coordinate in the other. But since
x and p are the components of vectors, while t and E aren’t, the correct correspondence must be
ct ←→ E and x ←→ pc.

Relativity (Dynamics)

(cid:16)p. Therefore, since Eq. (12.27) is a linear equation in the E’s and p’s, it also holds for
the (cid:16)E’s and (cid:16)p’s. That is,

(cid:16)E = γ ((cid:16)E

(cid:16) + v(cid:16)p

(cid:16)),

and (cid:16)p = γ ((cid:16)p

(cid:16) + v(cid:16)E

(cid:16)).

(12.30)

So if the total (cid:16)E(cid:16) and (cid:16)p(cid:16) in S(cid:16) are zero, then the total (cid:16)E and (cid:16)p in S must also be zero.
2. Equation (12.30) makes it clear that if you accept the fact that p = γ mv is conserved in
all frames, then you must also accept the fact that E = γ m is conserved in all frames
(and vice versa). This is true because the second of Eqs. (12.30) says that if (cid:16)p and
(cid:16)p(cid:16) are both zero, then (cid:16)E(cid:16) must also be zero. E and p have no choice but to go hand
in hand. ♣

Equation (12.27) applies to the x component of the momentum. How do the
transverse components, py and pz, transform? Just as with the y and z coordinates
in the Lorentz transformations, py and pz don’t change between frames. The
analysis in Chapter 13 makes this obvious, so for now we’ll simply state that if
the relative velocity between the frames is in the x direction, then

py = p

(cid:16)
y,

and

pz = p

(cid:16)
z.

(12.31)

If you really want to show explicitly that the transverse components don’t change
between frames, or if you’re worried that a nonzero speed in the y direction will
mess up the relationship between px and E that we calculated in Eq. (12.27), then
Exercise 12.23 is for you. But it’s a bit tedious, so feel free to settle for the much
cleaner reasoning in Chapter 13.

12.3 Collisions and decays

The strategy for studying relativistic collisions is the same as that for studying
nonrelativistic ones. You just have to write down all the conservation of energy
and momentum equations, and then solve for whatever variables you want to
solve for. The conservation principles are the same as they’ve always been. The
only difference is that now the energy and momentum take the new forms in

equations,
to put E and p together into one
four-component vector,

it proves extremely useful

P ≡ (E, p) ≡ (E, px, py, pz).

(12.32)

This is called the energy–momentum 4-vector, or the 4-momentum, for short. If we
were keeping in the factors of c, then the first term would be E/c, although some
people instead multiply the p by c; either convention is fine. Our notation in this
chapter will be to use an uppercase P to denote a 4-momentum and a lowercase
p or p to denote a spatial momentum. The components of a 4-momentum are
usually indexed from 0 to 3, so that P0 ≡ E, and (P1, P2, P3) ≡ p. For one
particle, we have

P = (γ m, γ mvx, γ mvy, γ mvz).

(12.33)

12.3 Collisions and decays

597

The 4-momentum for a collection of particles consists of the total E and total
p of all the particles. There are deep reasons for considering the 4-momentum,
as we’ll see in Chapter 13, but for now we’ll just view it as a matter of conve-
nience. If nothing else, it helps with the bookkeeping. Conservation of energy
and momentum in a collision reduce to the concise statement,

Pbefore = Pafter,

(12.34)

where these are the total 4-momenta of all the particles.

If we define the inner product between two 4-momenta, A ≡ (A0, A1, A2, A3)

and B ≡ (B0, B1, B2, B3), to be

A · B ≡ A0B0 − A1B1 − A2B2 − A3B3,

(12.35)

then the Very Important Relation in Eq. (12.11), E2 − p2 = m2, which is true for
one particle, may be concisely written as

P · P = m2,

or P2 = m2,

(12.36)

where P2 ≡ P · P. In other words, the square of a particle’s 4-momentum equals
the square of its mass. This relation will prove to be very useful in collision
problems. Note that it is frame-independent, as we saw in Eq. (12.29).

This inner product is different from the one we’re used to in three-dimensional
space. It has one positive sign and three negative signs, in contrast with the usual
three positive signs. But we are free to define it however we wish, and we
did indeed pick a good definition, because our inner product is invariant under
Lorentz transformations, just as the usual 3-D inner product is invariant under
rotations. For the inner product of a 4-momentum with itself (which could be
any linear combination of 4-momenta of various particles), this invariance is
the statement in Eq. (12.29). For the inner product of two different 4-momenta,
we’ll prove the invariance in Section 13.3.

A particle with mass m and energy E
Example (Relativistic billiards):
approaches an identical particle at rest. They collide elastically8 in such a way that
they both scatter at an angle θ relative to the incident direction (see Fig. 12.7). What
is θ in terms of E and m? What is θ in the relativistic and nonrelativistic limits?

Solution: The first thing we should do is write down the 4-momenta. The
4-momenta before the collision are

P1 = (E, p, 0, 0), P2 = (m, 0, 0, 0),

(12.37)

8 An elastic collision in nonrelativistic physics is defined as one in which no heat is generated. In
relativity, heat shows up as mass. So an elastic collision in relativistic physics is defined as one in
which none of the masses change.

The relativistic limit is E (cid:6) m, which yields cos θ ≈ 1. This means that both particles
scatter almost directly forward. You can convince yourself that θ should be small by
looking at the collision in the CM frame and then shifting back to the lab frame. The
transverse speeds decrease during this shift of frames.
The nonrelativistic limit is E ≈ m (it’s not E ≈ 0), which yields cos θ ≈ 1/

Note that we never wrote down any v’s in the above solution. That is, we
never used the relations E = γ mc2 and p = γ mv. There was no need to find
the velocities; doing so would have essentially involved going in circles. Using
E = γ mc2 and p = γ mv certainly provides a valid way of solving the problem,
but in many situations like this one, where velocities aren’t given or explicitly
asked for, it leads to a very messy solution. A far cleaner method is to use the
E2 − p2 = m2 relation.

Let’s now look at a decay. Decays are basically the same as collisions. All you
have to do is conserve energy and momentum, as the following example shows.

12.3 Collisions and decays

599

Example (Decay at an angle): A particle with mass M and energy E decays
into two identical particles. In the lab frame, one of them is emitted at a 90
angle,
as shown in Fig. 12.8. What are the energies of the created particles? We’ll give two
solutions. The second one shows how 4-momenta can be used in a very clever and
time-saving way.

E2 − M 2. Let the created particles have mass m, and let the second

P1 = (E1, 0, p1, 0), P2 = (E2, p2 cos θ, −p2 sin θ, 0).

(12.42)

Conservation of px immediately gives p2 cos θ = p, which then implies that
p2 sin θ = p tan θ . Conservation of py says that the final py’s are opposites. Therefore,
the 4-momenta after the decay are

P1 = (E1, 0, p tan θ , 0), P2 = (E2, p, −p tan θ, 0).

(12.43)

Conservation of energy gives E = E1 + E2. Writing E1 and E2 in terms of the
momenta and masses, this becomes

(cid:15)

(cid:15)

E =

p2 tan2θ + m2 +

p2(1 + tan2θ) + m2.

(12.44)

Putting the first radical on the left side, squaring, and solving for that radical (which
is E1) gives

E1 = E2 − p2

In a similar manner, we find that E2 equals

(12.46)

These add up to E, as they should.

Second solution: With the 4-momenta defined as in Eqs. (12.41) and (12.42),
conservation of energy and momentum can be combined into the statement,
P = P1 + P2. Therefore,

P − P1 = P2,

=⇒ (P − P1) · (P − P1) = P2 · P2,
= P2

And then E2 = E − E1 = (2E2 − M 2)/2E. This solution should convince you that
4-momenta can save you a lot of work. What happened here was that the expression
for P2 was fairly messy, but we arranged things so that it appeared only in the form
of P2
2, which is simply m2. 4-momenta provide a remarkably organized method for
sweeping unwanted garbage under the rug.

12.4 Particle-physics units

A branch of physics that uses relativity as one of its main ingredients is
elementary-particle physics, which is the study of the building blocks of mat-
ter (electrons, quarks, neutrinos, etc.). It’s unfortunately the case that most
of the elementary particles we want to study don’t exist naturally in the
world. We therefore have to create them in particle accelerators by collid-
ing other particles together at very high energies. The high speeds involved
require the use of relativistic dynamics. Newtonian physics is essentially
useless.

What is a typical size of a rest energy, mc2, of an elementary particle? The
rest energy of a proton (which isn’t really elementary; it’s made up of quarks, but
never mind) is

Ep = mpc2 = (1.67 · 10

−27 kg)(3 · 108 m/s)2 = 1.5 · 10

−10 joules.

(12.48)

This is very small, of course. So a joule is probably not the best unit to work
with. We would get very tired of writing the negative exponents over and
over. We could perhaps work with “nanojoules,” but particle physicists like to
work instead with the “eV,” the electron-volt. This is the change in energy of an
electron when it passes through a potential of one volt. The electron charge is
(negative) e = 1.602 · 10−19 C, and a volt is defined as 1 V = 1 J/C. So the
conversion from eV to joules is9

1 eV = (1.602 · 10

−19 C)(1 J/C) = 1.602 · 10

−19 J.

(12.49)

Therefore, in terms of eV, the rest energy of a proton is 938 · 106 eV. We now
have the opposite problem of having a large exponent hanging around. But this
is easily remedied by the prefix “M,” which stands for “mega” or “million.” So
we finally have a proton rest energy of

Ep = 938 MeV.

(12.50)

9 This is getting a little picky, but “eV” should technically be written as “eV,” because when people
write “eV,” they actually mean that two things are being multiplied together (in contrast with, for
example, the “kg” symbol for “kilogram”). One of these things is the electron charge, which is
usually denoted by e.

12.5 Force

601

You can work out for yourself that an electron has a rest energy of
Ee = 0.511 MeV. The rest energies of various particles are listed in the table
below. The ones preceded by a “≈” are the averages of differently charged parti-
cles, whose energies differ by a few MeV. These (and the many other) elementary
particles have specific properties (spin, charge, etc.), but for the present purposes
they need only be thought of as point objects having a definite mass.

For higher energies, the prefixes “G” (for “giga,” meaning 109) and “T” (for
“tera,” meaning 1012) are used.

We now come to a slight abuse of language. When particle physicists talk
about masses, they say things like, “The mass of a proton is 938 MeV.” This,
of course, makes no sense, because the units are wrong; a mass can’t equal an
energy. But what they mean is that if you take this energy and divide it by c2,
then you get the mass. It would truly be a pain to keep saying, “The mass is such-
and-such an energy, divided by c2.” For a quick conversion back to kilograms,
you can show that

1 MeV/c2 = 1.783 · 10

−30 kg.

(12.51)

12.5 Force

12.5.1 Force in one dimension
In nonrelativistic physics, Newton’s second law is F = dp/dt, which reduces
to F = ma if the mass is constant. We’ll carry this law over to relativity and
continue to write (we’ll just deal with one-dimensional motion for now)

F = dp
dt

.

(12.52)

602

Relativity (Dynamics)

However, in relativity we have p = γ mv, and γ can change with time. This
complicates things, and it turns out that F does not equal ma. But if dp/dt
and ma are different, why does F equal dp/dt instead of ma? Perhaps the best
reason arises from the 4-vector formalism in Chapter 13. But another reason is
that the F in Eq. (12.52) leads to a familiar work–energy theorem, as we’ll see
in Eq. (12.57).

To see what form the F in Eq. (12.52) takes in terms of the acceleration

a ≡ ˙v, let’s first calculate dγ /dt:

(cid:2)

dγ

Assuming that m is constant, we therefore have

F = d(γ mv)

dt

= m( ˙γ v + γ ˙v) = maγ (γ 2v2 + 1) = γ 3ma.

(12.54)

This doesn’t look as nice as F = ma, but that’s the way it goes. However, F
correctly reduces to ma in the limit of small speeds (where γ ≈ 1), as it must.

They said, “F is ma, bar none.”
What they meant wasn’t quite as much fun.
It’s dp by dt,
Which just happens to be
Good ol’ “ma” when γ is 1.

Consider now the quantity dE/dx, where E is the energy, E = γ m. We have

But v(dv/dx) = (dx/dt)(dv/dx) = dv/dt = a. Therefore, dE/dx = γ 3ma.
Combining this with Eq. (12.54) gives

F = dE
dx

.

(12.56)

Note that Eqs. (12.52) and (12.56) take exactly the same form as in nonrelativistic
physics. The only new thing in relativity is that the expressions for p and E are
modified.

Remark: The result in Eq. (12.56) suggests another way to motivate the E = γ m expression.
The reasoning is exactly the same as in the derivation of nonrelativistic energy conservation in
Section 5.1. Define F, as we have done, through Eq. (12.52). Then integrate Eq. (12.54) from
x1 to x2 to obtain

energy as E = γ m, then the work–energy theorem,
does in Newtonian physics. The only difference is that E is γ m instead of mv2/2. 10 ♣

(cid:17)

12.5.2 Force in two dimensions

In two dimensions, the concept of force becomes a little strange. In particular,
as we’ll see, the acceleration of an object need not point in the same direction as
the force. We start with

F = dp
dt

.

(12.58)

This is a vector equation. Without loss of generality, we’ll deal with only two
spatial dimensions. Consider a particle moving in the x direction, and let us apply
a force, F = (Fx, Fy). The particle’s momentum is

p =

(cid:15)

m(vx, vy)
1 − v2

(12.60)

This is not proportional to (ax, ay). The first component agrees with Eq. (12.54),
but the second component has only one factor of γ . The difference comes from the
fact that γ has a first-order change if vx changes, but not if vy changes, assuming
that vy is initially zero. The particle therefore responds differently to forces in the
x and y directions. It is easier to accelerate something in the transverse direction.

10 Actually, this reasoning suggests only that E is given by γ m up to an additive constant. For all
we know, E might take the form, E = γ m − m, which would make the energy of a motionless
particle equal to zero. An argument along the lines of Section 12.1.2 is required to show that the
additive constant is zero.

Let a force act on a particle. How are the components of the force in the particle’s
frame, S(cid:16), related to the components of the force in another frame, S?11 Let the
relative motion be along the x and x(cid:16) axes, as shown in Fig. 12.9. In frame S,
Eq. (12.60) says

(Fx, Fy) = m(γ 3ax, γ ay).

(12.61)

And in frame S(cid:16), the γ factor for the particle equals 1, so Eq. (12.60) reduces to
the usual expression,

(F

(cid:16)
(cid:16)
x, F
y

(cid:16)
(cid:16)
) = m(a
x, a
y

).

(12.62)

Let’s now relate these two forces, by writing the primed accelerations on the
right-hand side of Eq. (12.62) in terms of the unprimed accelerations.

First, we have a(cid:16)
y

= γ 2ay. This is true because transverse distances are the
same in the two frames, but times are shorter in S(cid:16) by a factor γ . That is, dt(cid:16) =
dt/γ . We have indeed put the γ in the right place here, because the particle
is essentially at rest in S(cid:16), so the usual time dilation holds. Therefore, a(cid:16)
≡
y
d2y(cid:16)/dt(cid:16)2 = d2y/(dt/γ )2 ≡ γ 2ay.

Second, we have a(cid:16)
x

= γ 3ax. In short, this is true because time dilation brings
in two factors of γ (as in the ay case), and length contraction brings in one. In
more detail: Let the particle move from one point to another in frame S(cid:16), as it
accelerates from rest in S(cid:16). Mark these two points, which are essentially a distance
a(cid:16)
(dt(cid:16))2/2 apart, in S(cid:16). As S(cid:16) flies past S, the distance between the two marks
x
is length contracted by a factor γ , as viewed by S. This distance (which is the
excess distance the particle travels over what it would have traveled if there were
no acceleration) is what S calls ax(dt)2/2. Therefore,

Remarks:

1. What if someone comes along and switches the labels of the primed and unprimed frames
in Eq. (12.65), and concludes that the transverse force is smaller in the particle’s frame?
He certainly can’t be correct, given that Eq. (12.65) is true, but where is the error? The
error lies in the fact that we (correctly) used dt(cid:16) = dt/γ above, because this is the relevant
expression concerning two events along the particle’s worldline. We are interested in two
such events, because we want to see how the particle moves. The inverted expression,
dt = dt(cid:16)/γ , deals with two events located at the same position in S, and therefore has
nothing to do with the situation at hand. Similar reasoning holds for the relation between
dx and dx(cid:16). Because we are dealing with a given particle, there is indeed one frame that
is special among all possible frames, namely the particle’s instantaneous inertial frame.
2. If you want to compare forces in two frames, neither of which is the particle’s rest frame,
then just use Eq. (12.65) twice and relate each of the forces to the rest-frame forces. It
quickly follows that for another frame S(cid:16)(cid:16), we have F (cid:16)(cid:16)
= γ Fy, where

Example (Bead on a rod): A spring with a tension has one end attached to the
end of a rod, and the other end attached to a bead that is constrained to move along the
rod. The rod makes an angle θ (cid:16)
(cid:16)
axis, and is fixed at rest in the S
with respect to the x
frame (see Fig. 12.10). The bead is released and is pulled along the rod by the spring.
Right after the bead is released, what does the situation look like in the frame, S, of
someone moving to the left at speed v? In answering this, draw the directions of

(cid:16)

(a) the rod,
(b) the acceleration of the bead,
(c) the force on the bead.

In frame S, does the wire exert a force of constraint?

Solution:

In frame S:

(a) The horizontal span of the rod is decreased by a factor γ , due to length con-
traction, and the vertical span is unchanged, so we have tan θ = γ tan θ (cid:16)
, as
shown in Fig. 12.11.

(b) The acceleration must point along the rod, because the bead always lies on
the rod, and because the rod moves at constant speed in S. Quantitatively, the
position of the bead in S takes the form of (x, y) = (vt − axt2/2, −ayt2/2), by
the definition of acceleration. The position relative to the starting point on the
rod, which has coordinates (vt, 0), is then ((cid:16)x, (cid:16)y) = (−axt2/2, −ayt2/2).
The condition for the bead to stay on the rod is that the ratio of these coordinates
equals the slope of the rod in S. Therefore, ay/ax = tan θ, and the acceleration
points along the rod.

As a double-check that a does indeed point along the rod, we can use Eq. (12.60)
= γ tan θ (cid:16) =
to write ay/ax = γ 2Fy/Fx. Then Eq. (12.65) gives ay/ax = γ F
tan θ , which is the direction of the wire.
The wire does not exert a force of constraint. The bead doesn’t need to touch the
wire in S
, so it doesn’t need to touch it in S. There is no need to have an extra force
to combine with F to make the result point along a, because F simply doesn’t have
to be collinear with a.

12.6 Rocket motion

Up to this point, we have dealt with situations where the masses of our particles
are constant, or where they change abruptly (as in a decay, where the sum of
the masses of the products is less than the mass of the initial particle). But in
many setups, the mass of an object changes continuously. A rocket is the classic
example of this, so we’ll use the term “rocket motion” to describe the general
class of problems where the mass changes continuously.

The relativistic rocket itself encompasses all of the important ideas, so we’ll
study that example here. Many more examples are left for the problems. We’ll
present three solutions to the rocket problem, the last of which is rather slick. In
the end, the solutions are all basically the same, but it should be helpful to see
the various ways of looking at things.

Example (Relativistic rocket): Assume that a rocket propels itself by con-
tinually converting mass into photons and firing them out the back. Let m be the
instantaneous mass of the rocket, and let v be the instantaneous speed with respect
to the ground. Show that

dm
m

+ dv
1 − v2

= 0.

(12.66)

If the initial mass is M , and the initial v is zero, integrate Eq. (12.66) to obtain

(cid:1)

m = M

1 − v
1 + v .

(12.67)

First solution: The strategy of this solution will be to use conservation of momen-
tum in the ground frame. Consider the effect of a small mass being converted into
photons. The mass of the rocket goes from m to m + dm (where dm is negative). So in
the frame of the rocket, photons with total energy Er = −dm (which is positive) are
fired out the back. In the frame of the rocket, these photons have momentum pr = dm
(which is negative). We’ll drop the c’s here.
Let the rocket move at speed v with respect to the ground. Then the momentum of
the photons in the ground frame, pg, can be found via the Lorentz transformation,

(cid:5)

(cid:6)

dm + v(−dm)

= γ (1 − v) dm.

(12.68)

pg = γ (pr + vEr) = γ

This is still negative, of course.

12.6 Rocket motion

607

Remark: A common error is to say that the converted mass (−dm) takes the form
of photons of energy (−dm) in the ground frame. This is incorrect, because although
the photons have energy (−dm) in the rocket frame, they are redshifted (due to the
Doppler effect) in the ground frame. From Eq. (11.51), we see that the frequency (and
(1 − v)/(1 + v) when going
hence the energy) of the photons decreases by a factor of
from the rocket frame to the ground frame. This factor equals the γ (1 − v) factor
in Eq. (12.68). ♣

√

We can now use conservation of momentum in the ground frame to say that

(mγ v)old = γ (1 − v) dm + (mγ v)new =⇒ γ (1 − v) dm + d(mγ v) = 0.

(12.69)

The d(mγ v) term may be expanded to give

d(mγ v) = (dm)γ v + m(dγ )v + mγ (dv)

= γ v dm + m(γ 3v dv)v + mγ dv

= γ v dm + mγ (γ 2v2 + 1) dv

= γ v dm + mγ 3 dv.

(12.70)

Therefore, Eq. (12.69) gives

Hence,

0 = γ (1 − v) dm + γ v dm + mγ 3dv

= γ dm + mγ 3 dv.

(12.75)

in agreement with Eq. (12.67). This result is independent of the rate at which the
mass is converted into photons. It is also independent of the frequency of the emitted
photons. Only the total mass expelled matters. Note that Eq. (12.75) quickly tells us
that the energy of the rocket, as a function of velocity, is

E = γ m = γ M

(cid:1)

1 − v
1 + v

= M

1 + v .

(12.76)

This has the interesting property of approaching M /2 as v → c. In other words,
half of the initial energy remains with the rocket, and half ends up as photons (see
Exercise 12.38).

Remark: From Eq. (12.68), or from the previous remark, we see that the ratio of the
(1 − v)/(1 + v).
energy of the photons in the ground frame to that in the rocket frame is
This factor is the same as the factor in Eq. (12.75). In other words, the photons’ energy in
the ground frame decreases in exactly the same manner as the mass of the rocket (assuming
that the photons are ejected with the same frequency in the rocket frame throughout the
process). Therefore, in the ground frame, the ratio of the photons’ energy to the mass of
the rocket doesn’t change with time. There must be a nice intuitive explanation for this,
but it eludes me. ♣

√

Second solution: The strategy of this solution will be to use F = dp/dt in
the ground frame. Let τ denote the time in the rocket frame. Then in the rocket
frame, dm/dτ is the rate at which the mass of the rocket decreases and is converted
into photons (dm is negative). The photons therefore acquire momentum at the rate
dp/dτ = dm/dτ in the rocket frame. Since force is the rate of change in momentum,
we see that a force of dm/dτ pushes the photons backward, and so an equal and
opposite force of F = −dm/dτ pushes the rocket forward in the rocket frame.
Now go to the ground frame. We know from Eq. (12.65) that the longitudinal force
is the same in both frames, so F = −dm/dτ is also the force on the rocket in the
ground frame. And since dt = γ dτ , where t is the time on the ground (the photon
emissions occur at the same place in the rocket frame, so we have indeed put the
time-dilation factor of γ in the right place), we have

F = −γ dm
dt

.

(12.77)

Remark: We can also calculate the force on the rocket by working entirely in the ground
frame. Consider a mass (−dm) that is converted into photons. Initially, this mass is traveling
along with the rocket, so it has momentum (−dm)γ v. After it is converted into photons, it
has momentum γ (1 − v) dm (from the first solution above). The change in momentum is
therefore γ (1−v) dm−(−dm)γ v = γ dm. Since force is the rate of change in momentum,
a force of γ dm/dt pushes the photons backward, and so an equal and opposite force of
F = −γ dm/dt pushes the rocket forward. ♣

Now things get a little tricky. It is tempting to write down F = dp/dt = d(mγ v)/dt,
which gives F = (dm/dt)γ v + m d(γ v)/dt. This, however, is incorrect, because the

12.7 Relativistic strings

609

dm/dt term isn’t relevant here. When the force is applied to the rocket at an instant
when the rocket has mass m, the only thing the force cares about is that the mass of
the rocket at the given instant is m. It doesn’t care that m is changing.13 Therefore,
the correct expression we want is

F = m

d(γ v)
dt

.

(12.78)

As in the first solution above, or in Eq. (12.54), we have d(γ v)/dt = γ 3 dv/dt. Using
the F from Eq. (12.77), we arrive at

−γ dm
dt

= mγ 3 dv
dt

,

(12.79)

which is equivalent to Eq. (12.71). The solution proceeds as above.

Third solution: The strategy of this solution will be to use conservation of energy
and momentum in the ground frame, in a slick way. Consider a clump of photons fired
out the back. The energy and momentum of these photons are equal in magnitude
and opposite in sign (with the convention that the photons are fired in the negative
direction). By conservation of energy and momentum, the same statement must be
true about the changes in energy and momentum of the rocket. That is,

d(γ m) = −d(γ mv) =⇒ d(γ m + γ mv) = 0.

(12.80)

Therefore, γ m(1 + v) is a constant. We are given that m = M when v = 0. Hence,
the constant equals M . Therefore,

γ m(1 + v) = M =⇒ m = M

(cid:1)

1 − v
1 + v .

(12.81)

Now, that’s a quick solution, if there ever was one!

12.7 Relativistic strings

Consider a “massless” string with a tension that is constant, that is, independent
of length.14 We call such objects relativistic strings, and we will study them for
two reasons. First, these strings, or reasonable approximations thereof, actually
do occur in nature. For example, the gluon force which holds quarks together is
approximately constant over distance. And second, they open the door to a whole
new class of setups we can study, such as the two below. Relativistic strings might

13 Said in a different way, the momentum associated with the ejected mass still exists. It’s just that
it’s not part of the rocket anymore; it’s in the photons. This issue is expanded on in Appendix C.
14 By “massless,” we mean that the string has no mass in its unstretched (that is, zero-length) state.

Once it is stretched, it will have energy in its rest frame, and hence mass.

seem a bit strange, but any one-dimensional problem involving them basically
comes down to the two equations,

F = dp

and F = dE

.

(12.82)

Example (Mass connected to a wall): A mass m is connected to a wall by a
relativistic string with tension T . The mass starts next to the wall and has an initial
speed v away from it (see Fig. 12.12). How far from the wall does the mass get? How
much time does it take to reach this point?

Solution: Let (cid:2) be the maximum distance from the wall. The initial energy of
the mass is E = γ m. The final energy at x = (cid:2) is simply m, because the mass is
instantaneously at rest there. Integrating F = dE/dx, and using the fact that the force
always equals −T , gives

F(cid:16)x = (cid:16)E =⇒ (−T )(cid:2) = m − γ m =⇒ (cid:2) = m(γ − 1)

T

.

(12.83)

Let t be the time it takes to reach this point. The initial momentum of the mass is
p = γ mv. Integrating F = dp/dt, and using the fact that the force always equals
−T , gives

F(cid:16)t = (cid:16)p =⇒ (−T )t = 0 − γ mv =⇒ t =

γ mv
T

.

(12.84)

Note that we cannot use F = ma to do this problem. F does not equal ma. It equals
dp/dt (and also dE/dx).

Example (Where the masses meet): A relativistic string of length (cid:2) and ten-
sion T connects a mass m and a mass M (see Fig. 12.13). The masses are released
from rest. Where do they meet?

Solution: Let the masses meet at a distance x from the initial position of m. At this
meeting point, F = dE/dx tells us that the energy of m is m + Tx, and the energy of M
is M + T ((cid:2) − x). Using p =
E2 − m2 we see that the magnitudes of the momenta
at the meeting point are

(cid:4)

(cid:15)

(cid:15)

pm =

(m + Tx)2 − m2

and

pM =

(M + T ((cid:2) − x))2 − M 2 .

(12.85)

But F = dp/dt tells us that these must be equal, because the same force (in magnitude,
but opposite in direction) acts on the two masses for the same time. Equating the above
p’s yields

(cid:6)
M + T ((cid:2)/2)

This result is reassuring, because it is the location of the initial center of mass, with
the string being treated (quite correctly) like a stick of length (cid:2) and mass T (cid:2) (divided
by c2).

Remark: Let’s check a few limits. In the limit of large T or (cid:2) (more precisely, in the
limit T (cid:2) (cid:6) Mc2 and T (cid:2) (cid:6) mc2), we have x = (cid:2)/2. This makes sense, because in this
case the masses are negligible and therefore both move at essentially speed c, and hence
meet in the middle. In the limit of small T or (cid:2) (more precisely, in the limit T (cid:2) (cid:4) Mc2
and T (cid:2) (cid:4) mc2), we have x = M (cid:2)/(M + m), which is simply the Newtonian result for an
everyday-strength massless spring. ♣

12.33. Higgs production *

Fig. 12.27

The Higgs boson is a proposed elementary particle that should be exper-
imentally detected in a few years, assuming it exists. One strategy
for producing it in a high-energy particle accelerator is to collide pro-
tons and antiprotons together. Taking the rest energy of a proton (and
antiproton) to be about 1 GeV, and assuming that the rest energy of the
Higgs is about 100 GeV, how much energy is required to produce the
Higgs if:

(a) A moving proton collides with a stationary antiproton?
(b) A proton and antiproton have equal and opposite momenta?

12.34. Maximum energy **

(a) A particle of mass M decays into a number of particles, some of
which may be photons. If one of the particles has mass m, and

if the sum of the masses of all the other products is µ, what is
the maximum possible energy that m can have? Hint: Write the
conservation of energy and momentum statements as PM −Pm =
Pµ, where Pµ is the total 4-momentum of the other products, and
then square. The technique of Problem 12.5 may be useful.
(b) In beta decay, a neutron decays into a proton, an electron, and a
neutrino (which is essentially a photon, for the present purposes).
The rest energies are En = 939.6 MeV, Ep = 938.3 MeV, Ee =

electron can have? The neutrino? Interpret your results.

Section 12.5: Force

12.35. Force and a collision *

Two identical masses m are initially at rest, a distance x apart. Aconstant
force F accelerates one of them toward the other until they collide and
stick together. What is the mass of the resulting particle?

12.36. Pushing on a mass **

(a) A mass m starts at rest. You push on it with a constant force F.
How much time t does it take for the mass to move a distance x?
(Both t and x here are measured in the lab frame.)

(b) After a very long time, m’s speed will approach c. It turns out that
it approaches c sufficiently fast so that after a very long time, m
will remain (approximately) a constant distance (as measured in
the lab frame) behind a photon that was emitted at t = 0 from
the starting position of m. What is this distance?

12.37. Momentum paradox ****

Two equal masses are connected by a massless string with tension T .
The masses are constrained to move with speed v along parallel lines, as
shown in Fig. 12.28. The constraints are then removed, and the masses
are drawn together. They collide and make one blob which continues to
move to the right. Is the following reasoning correct? If your answer is
“no,” state what is invalid about whichever of the four sentences is/are
invalid.

“The forces on the masses point in the y direction. Therefore, there
is no change in the momentum of the masses in the x direction. But the
mass of the resulting blob is greater than the sum of the initial masses
(because they collide with some relative speed). Therefore, the speed
of the resulting blob must be less than v (to keep px constant), so the
whole apparatus slows down in the x direction.”

A mass m is placed right in front of an identical one. They are connected

12.10 Solutions

12.1. Deriving E and p

Let’s derive the energy formula, E = γ mc2, first. Let the given mass decay into
two photons, and let E0 be the energy of the mass in its rest frame. Then each of the
resulting photons has energy E0/2 in this frame.

Eq. (11.51),
√

(1 + v)/(1 − v) and

Now look at the decay in a frame where the mass moves at speed v. From
the frequencies of the photons are Doppler-shifted by the factors
(1 − v)/(1 + v). Since the energies of the photons are given
by E = hν, they are shifted by the same Doppler factors, relative to the E0/2 value
in the original frame. The total energy of the photons in the frame where the mass
moves at speed v is therefore

(12.91)

By conservation of energy, this is the energy of the mass m moving at speed v. So we
see that a moving mass has an energy that is γ times its rest energy.

We can now use the correspondence principle (which says that relativistic formulas
must reduce to the familiar nonrelativistic ones in the nonrelativistic limit) to find
E0 in terms of m and c. We just found that the difference between the energies of a
moving mass and a stationary mass is γ E0 − E0. This must reduce to the familiar
kinetic energy, mv2/2, in the limit v (cid:4) c. In other words,

We can derive the momentum formula, p = γ mv, in a similar way. Let the mag-
nitude of the photons’ (equal and opposite) momenta in the particle’s rest frame be
p0/2.16 Since the photons’ momenta are given by E = hν/c, we can use the Doppler-
shifted frequencies as we did above to say that the total momentum of the photons in
the frame where the mass moves at speed v is

Putting the c’s back in, we have p = γ p0v/c. By conservation of momentum, this is

We can now use the correspondence principle to find p0 in terms of m and c. If
p = γ (p0/c)v is to reduce to the familiar p = mv result in the limit v (cid:4) c, then we
must have p0 = mc. Therefore, p = γ mv.

12.2. Colliding photons

The 4-momenta of the photons are (see Fig. 12.29)

Pγ1

= (E, E, 0, 0),

and Pγ2

= (E, E cos θ , E sin θ , 0).

(12.94)

Energy and momentum are conserved, so the 4-momentum of the final particle is
PM = (2E, E + E cos θ , E sin θ , 0). Therefore,

M 2 = PM · PM = (2E)2 − (E + E cos θ )2 − (E sin θ )2,

(12.95)

which gives

If θ = 180◦ then M = 2E, as it should (none of the final energy is kinetic). And if
θ = 0◦ then M = 0, as it should (all of the final energy is kinetic; we simply have a
photon with twice the energy).

12.3. Increase in mass

(12.98)

1 + (cid:9) ≈ 1 + (cid:9)/2. Therefore, the increase
where we have used the Taylor series,
in mass is γ times the mass of the stationary object. This increase is greater than the
nonrelativistic answer of “m,” because heat is generated during the collision, and this
heat shows up as mass in the final object.

Remark: The γ m result is clear if we work in the frame where M is initially at rest.
In this frame, the mass m comes flying in with energy γ m, and then essentially all
of this energy shows up as mass in the final object. That is, essentially none of it
shows up as overall kinetic energy of the object. This negligible-kinetic-energy result
is a general one whenever a small object hits a stationary large one. It follows from
the fact that the speed of the large object is proportional to m/M , by momentum

16 With the given information that a photon has E = hν and p = hν/c, we can use the preceding
E0 = mc2 result to quickly conclude that p0 = mc. But let’s pretend that we haven’t found E0
yet. This will give us an excuse to use the correspondence principle again.

conservation (there’s a factor of γ if things are relativistic), so the kinetic energy
goes like M v2 ∝ M (m/M )2 ≈ 0, if M (cid:6) m. In other words, the smallness of v
wins out over the largeness of M . When a snowball hits a tree, all (essentially) of
the initial energy goes into heat. None of it goes into changing the kinetic energy of
the earth. ♣

Remark: It turns out that the quantity under the radical can be factored into

(a + b + c)(a + b − c)(a − b + c)(a − b − c).

(12.103)

This makes it clear that if a = b + c, then p = 0, because there is no leftover energy for the
particles to be able to move. Interestingly, the form of p in Eq. (12.102) looks very much
like the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c, which is given by Heron’s formula as

(m, 0, 0, 0),

(12.105)

(cid:4)

where p =
E2 − m2. Therefore, the total 4-momentum of the final particles in
the lab frame is (E +m, p, 0, 0). The quantity E2
total is frame independent,
and it equals the square of the energy in the CM frame (where p = 0). So we

Since there is no relative motion among the final particles in the CM frame
at threshold there is also no relative motion in any other frame. This means
that at threshold the N masses travel together as a blob in the lab frame. The
threshold E is larger than the naive answer of (N −1)m, because the final state has
inevitable “wasted” energy in the form of kinetic energy (which is necessitated
by conservation of momentum) in the lab frame. Note that E ∝ N 2 for large N .

Remark: Let’s look at some limits:

1. E ≈ M (barely moving): then E(cid:16) ≈ M , because M is still barely moving.
2. M = m: then E(cid:16) = M , because M stops, and m picks up all the energy that

M had.

3. m (cid:6) E (> M ) (brick wall): then E(cid:16) ≈ E, because the heavy mass m picks up

essentially no energy.

4. (E >) M (cid:6) m and M 2 (cid:6) Em: then E(cid:16) ≈ E, because it’s essentially like m

isn’t there.

5. (E >) M (cid:6) m but Em (cid:6) M 2: then E(cid:16) ≈ M 2/2m. This isn’t obvious, but it’s
interesting that it doesn’t depend on E. This means that no matter how fast you
throw a big object at a small one (head-on), the big one will always (as long
as you throw it hard enough) end up with the same energy, M 2/2m. And since

12.10 Solutions

623

we’re assuming M 2 (cid:4) Em, this resulting energy is much less than E. So most
of the (very large) initial energy ends up in m.

6. E (cid:6) m (cid:6) M : then E(cid:16) ≈ m/2. This isn’t obvious, but it’s similar to an analogous
limit in the Compton scattering in Problem 12.7. As above, no matter how fast
you throw a small object at a big one (head-on), the small one will always (as
long as you throw it hard enough) end up with the same energy, m/2. ♣

Remark: Let’s look at some limits:

1. If θ ≈ 0 (that is, not much scattering), then λ(cid:16) ≈ λ, as expected.
2. If θ = π (that is, backward scattering), then λ(cid:16) = λ + 2h/mc.
3. If θ = π and additionally λ (cid:4) h/mc (that is, mc2 (cid:4) hc/λ = Eγ , so the photon’s
energy is much larger than the electron’s rest energy), then λ(cid:16) ≈ 2h/mc, so

Therefore, the photon bounces back with an essentially fixed E(cid:16)
γ , independent
of the initial Eγ (as long as Eγ is large enough). This isn’t obvious. In fact, it’s
not even obvious that the photon can bounce straight back. You might think that
if it has enough energy, it will end up moving forward along with the electron.
However, in the CM frame, the photon bounces backward in a head-on collision.
So it must bounce backward in every frame, because a photon’s direction can’t
switch when going from one frame to another. ♣

12.8. System of masses

Let the speed of the stick go from zero to (cid:9), where (cid:9) (cid:4) v. Then the final speeds
of the two masses are obtained by relativistically adding or subtracting (cid:9) from v.
(Assume that the time involved is small, so that the masses are still essentially
moving horizontally.) Repeating the derivation leading to Eq. (12.26), we see that
the final momenta of the two masses have magnitudes γvγ(cid:9) (v ± (cid:9))m. But since
(cid:9) is small, we can set γ(cid:9) ≈ 1, to first order. Therefore, the forward-moving mass
has momentum γv(v + (cid:9))m, and the backward-moving mass has momentum
−γv(v − (cid:9))m. So the net increase in momentum is (cid:16)p = 2γ m(cid:9), where γ ≡ γv.
Hence,

We must somehow solve this differential equation. A helpful thing to do is to

12.10. Relativistic rocket

The relation between m and v obtained in Eq. (12.67) is independent of the rate
at which mass is converted into photons. The point of this problem is to assume
a certain rate, in order to obtain a relation between v and t.

In the frame of the rocket, we are given dm = −σ dτ . The usual time-dilation
effect gives dt = γ dτ , so we have dm = −(σ/γ ) dt in the ground frame.
Differentiating Eq. (12.67) to obtain another expression for dm, we have

Remarks:
Eq. (12.128) to obtain σ t/M ≈ v, which can be written as σ ≈ M (v/t) ≡ Ma. But σ
equals the force acting on the rocket (or rather σ c, to make the units correct), because
−σ is the rate of change in momentum of the photons (since their momentum is
p = −E/c = −(dm c2)/c). We therefore obtain the expected nonrelativistic F = ma
equation.

If v = 1 − (cid:9), where (cid:9) is very small (that is, if v is very close to c), then we can
make approximations in Eq. (12.128) to obtain (cid:9) ≈ (2e)e−4σ t/M . We see that the
difference between v and 1 decreases exponentially with t. ♣

12.11. Relativistic dustpan I

This problem is essentially the same as Problem 12.3. Let M
be the mass of
the dustpan-plus-dust-inside system (which we’ll label “S”) when its speed is
v. After a small time dt in the lab frame, S has moved a distance v dt, so it has
basically collided with an infinitesimal mass λv dt. Its energy therefore increases
to γ M + λv dt. Its momentum is still γ M v, so its mass is now

(12.130)

The rate of increase in S’s mass is therefore γ λv. As in Problem 12.3, this increase
is greater than the nonrelativistic answer of “λv,” because heat is generated dur-
ing the collision, and this heat shows up as mass in the final object.

Remarks: As explained in the remark in the solution to Problem 12.3, this result is
clear if we work in the dustpan frame. In this frame, the above-mentioned infinitesimal
mass λv dt comes flying in with energy γ (λv dt), and essentially all of this energy
shows up as mass in the final object.

Note that the rate at which the mass increases, as measured in the dustpan frame,
is γ 2λv, due to time dilation. The dust-entering-dustpan events happen at the same
location in the dustpan frame, so we have indeed put the extra γ factor in the correct
place. Alternatively, you can think in terms of length contraction. S sees the dust
contracted, so its density is increased to γ λ. And the other γ factor comes from
the fact that the dust is moving in the dustpan frame, so there is a γ factor in the
energy. ♣

12.12. Relativistic dustpan II

The initial momentum is γV MV ≡ P. There are no external forces, so the momen-
tum of the dustpan-plus-dust-inside system (denoted by “S”) always equals P.
That is, γ mv = P, where m and v are the mass and speed of S at any later time.
Let’s find v(x) first. The energy of S, namely γ m, increases due to the

acquisition of new dust. Therefore, d(γ m) = λ dx, which we can write as

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

P
v

d

= λ dx.

(12.131)

Integrating this, and using the fact that the initial speed is V , gives P/v − P/V =
λx. Therefore,

v(x) =

V
1 + (V λx/P) .

(12.132)

For large x, this approaches P/(λx). This makes sense, because the mass of S is
essentially equal to λx, and it is moving at a slow, nonrelativistic speed.

To find v(t), write the dx in Eq. (12.131) as v dt to obtain (−P/v2) dv = λv dt.

Remarks:

1. You can also obtain the result in Eq. (12.134) by equating the expressions for v
in Eqs. (12.132) and (12.133). Or you can write the v in Eq. (12.132) as dx/dt,
and then separate variables and integrate.

2. For small t, you can show that Eq. (12.134) reduces to x = Vt, as it should. For

√

large t, x has the interesting property of being proportional to

t.

3. Given P, all the results in this problem (when expressed in terms of P) are
actually the same as the ones obtained in the nonrelativistic case, because
Eq. (12.131) is still true there; it’s simply the expression for how the mass
changes in the nonrelativistic case. From that point on, relativity never entered
into the reasoning. ♣

12.13. Relativistic dustpan III

Dustpan frame: Let S denote the dustpan-plus-dust-inside system at a given
time, and consider a small bit of dust (call this system s) that enters the dustpan.
In S’s frame, the density of the dust is γ λ, due to length contraction. Therefore, in
a time dτ (where τ is the time in the dustpan frame), a little s system of dust with
mass γ λv dτ crashes into S and loses its negative momentum of −γ (γ λv dτ )v =
−γ 2v2λ dτ . The force on s is therefore F = dp/dτ = γ 2v2λ. The desired force
on S is equal and opposite to this, so

F = −γ 2v2λ.

(12.135)

Lab frame:
In a time dt, where t is the time in the lab frame, a little s system
of dust with mass λv dt gets picked up by the dustpan. What is the change in
momentum of s? It is tempting to say that it is γ (λv dt)v, but this would lead to
a force of −γ v2λ on the dustpan, which doesn’t agree with the result we found
above in the dustpan frame. This would be a problem, because longitudinal forces
should be the same in different frames.

The key point to realize is that the mass of whatever is moving increases at
a rate γ λv, and not λv (see Problem 12.11). We therefore see that the change
in momentum of the additional moving mass is γ (γ λv dt)v = γ 2v2λ dt. The
original moving system S therefore loses this much momentum, and so the force
on it is F = dp/dt = −γ 2v2λ, in agreement with the result in the dustpan frame.

12.14. Relativistic cart I

Ground frame (your frame): Using reasoning similar to that in Problem 12.3
and Problem 12.11, we see that the mass of the cart-plus-sand-inside system
increases at a rate γ σ . Therefore, its momentum increases at a rate (using the
fact that v is constant)

dp
dt

= γ

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

v = γ (γ σ )v = γ 2σ v.

(12.136)

Since F = dp/dt, this is the force that you exert on the cart. Therefore, it is also
the force that the ground exerts on your feet, because the net force on you is zero
(since your momentum is constant, and in fact zero).

Cart frame: The sand-entering-cart events happen at the same location in the
ground frame, so time dilation says that the sand enters the cart at a slower
rate in the cart frame, that is, at a rate σ/γ . The sand flies in at speed v, and
then eventually comes to rest on the cart, so its momentum decreases at a rate
γ (σ/γ )v = σ v. This must therefore be the force that your hand applies to
the cart.

628

Relativity (Dynamics)

If this were the only change in momentum in the problem, then we would have
a problem, because the force on your feet would be σ v in the cart frame, whereas
we found above that it is γ 2σ v in the ground frame. This would contradict the fact
that longitudinal forces are the same in different frames. What is the resolution to
this apparent paradox? The resolution is that while you are pushing on the cart,
your mass is decreasing. You are moving at speed v in the cart frame, and mass
is continually being transferred from you (who are moving) to the cart (which is
at rest), as we will show. This is the missing change in momentum that we need.
The quantitative reasoning is as follows.

Go back to the ground frame for a moment. We saw above that the mass of the
cart-plus-sand-inside system (call this system “C”) increases at a rate γ σ in the
ground frame. Therefore, the energy of C increases at a rate γ (γ σ ) in the ground
frame. The sand provides σ of this energy, so you must provide the remaining
(γ 2 − 1)σ part. Therefore, since you are losing energy at this rate, you must also
be losing mass at this rate in the ground frame (because you are at rest there).

Now go back to the cart frame. Due to time dilation, you lose mass at a rate of
only (γ 2 − 1)σ/γ . This mass goes from moving at speed v (that is, along with
you), to speed zero (that is, at rest on the cart). Therefore, the rate of decrease in
v = (γ 2 − 1)σ v. Adding this result
momentum of this mass is γ
to the σ v result we found for the sand, we see that the total rate of decrease in
momentum is γ 2σ v. This is therefore the force that the ground applies to your
feet, in agreement with the above calculation in the ground frame.

(γ 2 − 1)σ/γ

(cid:5)

(cid:6)

Note that the reason why we didn’t have to worry about your changing mass
when doing the calculation in the ground frame was that your speed there was
zero. Your momentum was therefore always zero, independent of what was
happening to your mass.

12.15. Relativistic cart II

Ground frame: Using reasoning similar to that in Problem 12.3 and Problem
12.11, we see that the mass of the cart-plus-sand-inside system increases at a
rate γ σ . Therefore, its momentum increases at a rate γ (γ σ )v = γ 2σ v. How-
ever, this is not the force that your hand exerts on the cart. The reason is that
your hand is receding from the location where the sand enters the cart, so your
hand cannot immediately be aware of the need for additional momentum. No
matter how rigid the cart is, it can’t transmit information faster than c. In a sense,
there is a sort of Doppler effect going on, and your hand needs to be responsi-
ble for only a certain fraction of the momentum increase. Let’s be quantitative
about this.

Consider two grains of sand that enter the cart a time t apart. What is the
difference between the two times that your hand becomes aware that the grains
have entered the cart? Assuming maximal rigidity (that is, assuming that signals
propagate along the cart at speed c), the relative speed (as measured by someone
on the ground) of the signals and your hand is c − v. The distance between the
two signals is ct. Therefore, they arrive at your hand separated by a time of
ct/(c − v). In other words, the rate at which you feel sand entering the cart is
(c − v)/c times the given σ rate. This is the factor by which we must multiply the
naive γ 2σ v result for the force we found above. The force you apply is therefore

Cart frame (your frame): The sand-entering-cart events happen at the same
location in the ground frame, so time dilation says that the sand enters the cart
at a slower rate in the cart frame, that is, at a rate σ/γ . The sand flies in at speed
v, and then eventually comes to rest on the cart, so its momentum decreases at
a rate γ (σ/γ )v = σ v. But again, this is not the force that your hand exerts on
the cart. As above, the sand enters the cart at a location that is receding from
your hand, so your hand cannot immediately be aware of the need for additional
momentum. Let’s be quantitative about this.

Consider two grains of sand that enter the cart a time t apart. What is the
difference between the two times that your hand becomes aware that the grains
have entered the cart? Assuming maximal rigidity (that is, assuming that signals
propagate along the cart at speed c), the relative speed (as measured by someone
on the cart) of the signals and your hand is c, because you are at rest. The distance
between the two signals is ct + vt, because the sand source is moving away from
you at speed v. Therefore, the signals arrive at your hand separated by a time of
(c + v)t/c. In other words, the rate at which you feel sand entering the cart is
c/(c + v) times the time-dilated σ/γ rate. This is the factor by which we must
multiply the naive σ v result for the force we found above. The force you apply
is therefore (dropping the c’s)

In a nutshell, the two naive results in the two frames, γ 2σ v and σ v, differ by
two factors of γ . But the ratio of the two “Doppler-effect” factors (which arose
from the impossibility of absolute rigidity) precisely remedies this discrepancy.
The reason why we didn’t need to consider this Doppler effect in Problem 12.14
is that there your hand is always right next to the point where the sand enters
the cart.

12.16. Different frames

(a) The energy of the resulting blob is 2m + T (cid:2). Since the blob is at rest, we have

(12.139)
(b) Let the new frame be S. Let the original frame be S(cid:16). The critical point to realize
is that in frame S, the left mass starts to accelerate before the right mass does.
This is due to the loss of simultaneity between the frames.

M = 2m + T (cid:2).

Consider the two events at which the two masses start to move. Let the
left mass and right mass start moving at positions xl and xr in S. The Lorentz
transformation (cid:16)x = γ ((cid:16)x(cid:16) + v(cid:16)t(cid:16)) tells us that xr − xl = γ (cid:2), because
(cid:16)x(cid:16) = (cid:2) and (cid:16)t(cid:16) = 0 for these events. Alternatively, this follows from length
contraction, because if we picture things in the original S(cid:16) frame, then the
length γ (cid:2) in S is what is length contracted down to (cid:2) in S(cid:16).

Let the masses collide at position xc in S. Then the gain in energy of the left
mass is T (xc − xl), and the gain in energy of the right mass is (−T )(xc − xr)
which is negative if xc > xr. We have used the fact that the longitudinal force
is the same in the two frames, so the masses still feel a tension T in frame S.
The gain in the sum of the energies of the two masses is therefore

(cid:16)E = T (xc − xl) + (−T )(xc − xr) = T (xr − xl) = T γ (cid:2).
The initial sum of the energies was 2γ m, so the final energy is

E = 2γ m + T γ (cid:2) = γ M ,

as desired.

M + T ((cid:2)/2), so the momentum is pb =

MT (cid:2) + T 2(cid:2)2/4. The energy at the wall is Ew =
Eb/2 + T ((cid:2)/2) = M /2 + 3T (cid:2)/4, so the momentum at the wall is pw =

12.18. Relativistic leaky bucket

(a) Let the wall be at x = 0, and let the initial position be x = (cid:2). Consider a small
interval during which the bucket moves from x to x + dx (where dx is negative).
The bucket’s energy changes by (−T ) dx due to the string (this is positive), and
also changes by a fraction dx/x, due to the leaking (this is negative). Therefore,
dE = (−T ) dx + E dx/x, or

dE

= −T + E
x

.

(12.145)

In solving this differential equation, it is convenient to introduce the variable
y ≡ E/x. With this definition, we have E(cid:16) = (xy)(cid:16) = xy(cid:16) + y, where a prime
denotes differentiation with respect to x. Equation (12.145) then becomes xy(cid:16) =
−T , or dy = −T dx/x. Integration gives y = −T ln x + C, which we can write
as y = −T ln(x/(cid:2)) + B, in order to have a dimensionless argument in the log.
Since E = xy, we therefore have

E(x) = Bx − Tx ln(x/(cid:2)),

(12.146)

where B is a constant of integration. The reasoning up to this point is valid for
both the total energy and the kinetic energy, because they both change in the
two ways described above. Let’s look at each case.
Total energy: Equation (12.146) gives

E = M (x/(cid:2)) − Tx ln(x/(cid:2)),
(12.147)
where the constant of integration, B, has been chosen to be M /(cid:2) so that E = M
when x = (cid:2). In terms of the fraction z ≡ x/(cid:2), we have E = Mz − T (cid:2)z ln z.

The fraction z must satisfy z ≤ 1, so we must have ln z ≤ 0. Therefore, a
solution for z exists only if M ≤ T (cid:2). If M ≥ T (cid:2), then the total energy decreases
all the way to the wall.

If M is slightly less then T (cid:2), then zmax is slightly less than 1, so E
Remarks:

rest of the way to the wall.

If M (cid:4) T (cid:2),

then E achieves its maximum at zmax ≈ 1/e, where it
has the value T (cid:2)/e. Essentially all of the energy is kinetic in this case, so
this result must agree with the result for the kinetic energy below, which it
indeed will. ♣
Kinetic energy: Equation (12.146) gives

K = −Tx ln(x/(cid:2)),
(12.149)
where the constant of integration, B, has been chosen to be zero so that K = 0
when x = (cid:2). Equivalently, E − K must equal the mass M (x/(cid:2)). In terms of
the fraction z ≡ x/(cid:2), we have K = −T (cid:2)z ln z. Setting dK/dz = 0 to find the

that are small compared with others when v (cid:4) c), this result must exactly equal
the nonrelativistic result. And indeed, the analogous “Leaky bucket” problem
in Chapter 5 (Problem 5.17) gives the same answer.

immediately moves with v ≈ c, so we have E ≈ pc. Therefore, E and
p should achieve their maxima at the same location. And indeed, we saw
above that Emax occurs at zmax ≈ 1/e.

2. If M (cid:6) T (cid:2), then ln zmax ≈ −1/2 =⇒ zmax ≈ 1/

terms over the N parts of the process. So we have, using an indexing notation

17 Although the tension T acts on two different things (the mass m initially, and then the blob), it is
valid to use the total (cid:16)p to obtain the total time via (cid:16)t = (cid:16)p/F, because if we wanted to, we
could break up the (cid:16)p into its two parts, and then find the two partial times, and then add them
back together to get the total (cid:16)t.

that we don’t need to know this. All we need to know is that it is constant.

4-vectors

We now come to a very powerful concept in relativity, that of 4-vectors. Although
it’s possible to derive everything in Special Relativity without the use of 4-vectors
(and indeed, this is the route, give or take, that we’ve taken in the previous two
chapters), they are extremely helpful in making calculations simpler and concepts
more transparent.

I have chosen to postpone the full introduction to 4-vectors until now, in order
to make it clear that everything in Special Relativity can be derived without them.
In encountering relativity for the first time, it’s nice to know that no “advanced”
techniques are required. But now that you’ve seen everything once, let’s go back
and derive various things in an easier way.

Although Special Relativity doesn’t require knowledge of 4-vectors, the sub-
ject of General Relativity definitely requires a firm understanding of tensors,
which are the generalization of 4-vectors. We won’t have time to go very deeply
into GR in Chapter 14, so you’ll just have to accept this fact. But suffice it to say
that an eventual understanding of GR requires a solid foundation in the 4-vectors
of Special Relativity. So let’s see what they’re all about.

13.1 Deﬁnition of 4-vectors
Deﬁnition 13.1 The 4-tuplet, A = (A0, A1, A2, A3), is a “4-vector” if the Ai
transform under a Lorentz transformation in the same way as (c dt, dx, dy, dz)
do. In other words, A is a 4-vector if it transforms like (assuming the Lorentz
transformation is along the x direction; see Fig. 13.1):

(cid:16)

(13.1)

Remarks:

1. Similar equations must hold, of course, for Lorentz transformations in the y and z

directions.

2. Additionally, the last three components must be a vector in 3-space. That is, they must
transform like a usual vector under rotations in 3-space. So the full definition of a 4-

x

S

Fig. 13.1

634

13.2 Examples of 4-vectors

635

vector is that it must transform like (c dt, dx, dy, dz) under Lorentz transformations and
rotations.

3. We’ll use a capital italic letter to denote a 4-vector. A bold-face letter will denote, as usual,

a vector in 3-space.

4. Lest we get tired of writing the c’s over and over, we’ll work in units where c = 1 from

now on.

5. The first component of a 4-vector is called the “time” component. The other three are the

“space” components.

6. The components in (dt, dx, dy, dz) are sometimes referred to as (dx0, dx1, dx2, dx3). Also,
some treatments use the indices “1” through “4,” with “4” being the “time” component.
But we’ll use “0” through “3.”

7. The Ai may be functions of v, the dxi, the xi and their derivatives, and any invariants (that

is, frame-independent quantities) such as the mass m.

8. 4-vectors are the obvious generalization of vectors in regular space. A vector in three
dimensions, after all, is something that transforms under a rotation just like (dx, dy, dz)
does. We have simply generalized a 3-D rotation to a 4-D Lorentz transformation. ♣

13.2 Examples of 4-vectors
So far, we have only one 4-vector at our disposal, namely (dt, dx, dy, dz). What are
some others? Well, (7dt, 7dx, 7dy, 7dz) certainly works, as does any other con-
stant multiple of (dt, dx, dy, dz). Indeed, m(dt, dx, dy, dz) is a 4-vector, because
m is an invariant. But how about A = (dt, 2dx, dy, dz)? No, this isn’t a 4-vector,
because on one hand it must transform (assuming it’s a 4-vector) like

(cid:16)

(13.3)

because this is how the dxi transform. The two preceding sets of equations are
inconsistent, so A = (dt, 2dx, dy, dz) is not a 4-vector. Note that if we had instead
considered the 4-tuplet, A = (dt, dx, 2dy, dz), then the two preceding equations
would have been consistent. But if we had then looked at how A transforms under
a Lorentz transformation in the y direction, we would have found that it is not a
4-vector.

636

4-vectors

The moral of this story is that the above definition of a 4-vector is a nontrivial
one because there are two possible ways that a 4-tuplet can transform. It can
transform according to the 4-vector definition, as in Eq. (13.2). Or it can transform
simply by having each of the Ai separately transform (using how the dxi, or
whatever else they may be made of, transform), as in Eq. (13.3). Only for certain
special 4-tuplets do these two methods give the same result. By definition, we
label these special 4-tuplets as 4-vectors.

Let’s now construct some less trivial examples of 4-vectors. In constructing
these, we’ll make abundant use of the fact that the proper-time interval, dτ ≡
√

dt2 − dr2, is an invariant.

• Velocity 4-vector: We can divide (dt, dx, dy, dz) by dτ , where dτ is the proper time
between two events (the same two events that yielded the dt, etc.). The result is indeed
a 4-vector, because dτ is independent of the frame in which it is measured. Using
dτ = dt/γ , we obtain

V ≡ 1

= (γ , γ v).

(13.4)

This is known as the velocity 4-vector. In the rest frame of the object we have v = 0,
so V reduces to V = (1, 0, 0, 0). With the c’s, we have V = (γ c, γ v).

• Energy–momentum 4-vector:
m, we obtain another 4-vector,

If we multiply the velocity 4-vector by the invariant

P ≡ mV = (γ m, γ mv) = (E, p),

(13.5)

which is known as the energy–momentum 4-vector (or the 4-momentum for short), for
obvious reasons. In the rest frame of the object, P reduces to P = (m, 0, 0, 0). With the
c’s, we have P = (γ mc, γ mv) = (E/c, p). Some treatments multiply through by c, so
that the 4-momentum is (E, pc).

• Acceleration 4-vector: We can also take the derivative of the velocity 4-vector with
respect to τ . The result is indeed a 4-vector, because taking the derivative entails tak-
ing the (infinitesimal) difference between two 4-vectors (which results in a 4-vector
because Eq. (13.1) is linear), and then dividing by the invariant dτ (which again results
in a 4-vector). Using dτ = dt/γ , we obtain

A ≡ dV

Using dγ /dt = v ˙v/(1 − v2)3/2 = γ 3v ˙v, we have

A = (γ 4v ˙v , γ 4v ˙vv + γ 2a),

(13.6)

(13.7)

where a ≡ dv/dt. A is known as the acceleration 4-vector. In the rest frame of the
object (or, rather, in the instantaneous inertial frame), A reduces to A = (0, a). As we

13.3 Properties of 4-vectors

637

usually do, we’ll pick the velocity v to point in the x direction. That is, v = (vx, 0, 0).
This means that v = vx, and also that ˙v = ˙vx ≡ ax.1 Equation (13.7) then becomes

A = (γ 4vxax, γ 4v2

x ax + γ 2ax, γ 2ay, γ 2az)

= (γ 4vxax, γ 4ax, γ 2ay, γ 2az).

(13.8)

We can keep taking derivatives with respect to τ to create other 4-vectors, but these
have little relevance in the real world.

• Force 4-vector: We define the force 4-vector as
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

F ≡ dP
dτ

= γ

dE
dt

,

dp
dt

= γ

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

, f

,

dE
dt

(13.9)

where f ≡ d(γ mv)/dt is the usual 3-force. We’ll use f instead of F in this chapter,
to avoid confusion with the 4-force, F. In the case where m is constant,2 F can be
written as F = d(mV )/dτ = m dV /dτ = mA. We therefore still have a nice “F equals
mA” law of physics, but it’s now a 4-vector equation instead of the old 3-vector one. In
terms of the acceleration 4-vector, we can use Eqs. (13.7) and (13.8) to write (if m is
constant)

F = mA = m(γ 4v ˙v, γ 4v ˙vv + γ 2a)

= m(γ 4vxax, γ 4ax, γ 2ay, γ 2az).

(13.10)

Combining this with Eq. (13.9), we see that the 3-force is

f = m(γ 3ax , γ ay , γ az),

(13.11)

in agreement with Eq. (12.60). In the rest frame of the object (or, rather, the instantaneous
inertial frame), the F in Eq. (13.9) reduces to F = (0, f ), because dE/dt = 0 when
v = 0, as you can verify. Also, in the rest frame of the object, the mA in Eq. (13.10)
reduces to mA = (0, ma). So F = mA reduces to the familiar f = ma.

13.3 Properties of 4-vectors

The appealing thing about 4-vectors is that they have many useful properties.
Let’s look at some of these.

• Linear combinations: If A and B are 4-vectors, then C ≡ aA + bB is also a 4-vector.
This is true because the transformations in Eq. (13.1) are linear (as we noted above

1 The acceleration vector a is free to point in any direction, but you can check that the 0’s in v lead

to ˙v = ax. See Exercise 13.5.

2 The mass m wouldn’t be constant if the object were being heated, or if extra mass were being added

to it. We won’t concern ourselves with such cases here.

638

4-vectors

when deriving the acceleration 4-vector). This linearity implies that the transformation
of, say, the time component is

(cid:16)
C0 ≡ (aA + bB)0 = aA0 + bB0 = a(A
0
(cid:16)
= (aA

(cid:16)

) + v(aA

)

(13.12)

which is the proper transformation for the time component of a 4-vector. Likewise for the
other components. This property holds, of course, just as it does for linear combinations
of vectors in 3-space.

• Inner-product invariance: Consider two arbitrary 4-vectors, A and B. Define their

inner product to be

A · B ≡ A0B0 − A1B1 − A2B2 − A3B3 ≡ A0B0 − A · B.

(13.13)

Then A · B is invariant. That is, it is independent of the frame in which it is calculated.
This can be shown by direct calculation, using the transformations in Eq. (13.1):

The importance of this result cannot be overstated. This invariance is analogous to the
invariance of the inner product, A · B, for rotations in 3-space. The above inner product
is also invariant under rotations in 3-space, because it involves the combination A · B.
The minus signs in the inner product may seem a little strange. But what we want is a
combination of two arbitrary vectors that is invariant under a Lorentz transformation,
because such combinations are very useful in seeing what’s going on in a system. The
nature of the Lorentz transformations demands that there be opposite signs in the inner
product, so that’s the way it is.

• Norm: As a corollary to the invariance of the inner product, we can look at the inner
product of a 4-vector with itself, which is by definition the square of the norm. We
see that

A2 ≡ A · A ≡ A0A0 − A1A1 − A2A2 − A3A3 = A2
0

− |A|2

(13.15)

13.4 Energy, momentum

A · A for rotations in
is invariant. This is analogous to the invariance of the norm
3-space. Special cases of the invariance of the 4-vector norm are the invariance of
c2dt2 − dx2 and of E2 − p2c2.

√

• A theorem: Here’s a nice little theorem:

If a certain one of the components of a 4-vector is 0 in every frame, then all four
components are 0 in every frame.

If one of the space components (say, A1) is 0 in every frame, then the other
Proof:
space components must also be 0 in every frame, because otherwise a rotation would
make A1 (cid:13)= 0. Also, the time component A0 must be 0 in every frame, because otherwise
a Lorentz transformation in the x direction would make A1 (cid:13)= 0.

If the time component, A0, is 0 in every frame, then the space components must
also be 0 in every frame, because otherwise a Lorentz transformation in the appropriate
direction would make A0 (cid:13)= 0.

If someone comes along and says that she has a vector in 3-space that has no x
component, no matter how you rotate the axes, then you would certainly say that the
vector must obviously be the zero vector. The situation in Lorentzian 4-space is the
same, because all the coordinates get intertwined with each other in the Lorentz (and
rotation) transformations.

Many useful things arise from the fact that the P in Eq. (13.5) is a 4-vector. The
invariance of the norm implies that P · P = E2 − |p|2 is invariant. If we are
dealing with only one particle, we can determine the value of P2 by conveniently
working in the rest frame of the particle (so that v = 0), which gives

E2 − p2 = m2,

(13.16)

or E2 − p2c2 = m2c4, with the c’s. We already knew this, of course, from just
writing out E2 − p2 = γ 2m2 − γ 2m2v2 = m2.

For a collection of particles, knowledge of the norm is very useful. If a process

involves many particles, then we can say that for any subset of the particles,

(cid:8)

E

−

(cid:7)(cid:19)

(cid:8)

p

is invariant,

(13.17)

because this is the norm of the sum of the energy–momentum 4-vectors of the
chosen particles. The sum is again a 4-vector, due to the linearity of Eq. (13.1).
What is the value of the invariant in Eq. (13.17)? The most concise description
(which is basically a tautology) is that it is the square of the energy in the CM
p = 0. For one particle, this reduces to
frame, that is, in the frame in which
m2. Note that the sums are taken before squaring in Eq. (13.17). Squaring before
adding would simply give the sum of the squares of the masses.

13.4.2 Transformations of E and p

We already know how the energy and momentum transform (see Section 12.2),
but let’s derive the transformation again here in a very quick and easy manner.
We know that (E, px, py, pz) is a 4-vector. So it must transform according to
Eq. (13.1). Therefore, for a Lorentz transformation in the x direction, we have

(cid:16) + vp
(cid:16)
),
E = γ (E
x
(cid:16)),
(cid:16)
+ vE
px = γ (p
x
py = p
pz = p

(cid:16)
y,
(cid:16)
z,

(13.18)

in agreement with Eq. (12.27). That’s all there is to it. The fact that E and p
are part of the same 4-vector provides an easy way to see that if one of them
is conserved (in every frame) in a collision, then the other is also. Consider an
interaction among a set of particles, and look at the 4-vector, (cid:16)P ≡ Pafter−Pbefore.
If E is conserved in every frame, then the time component of (cid:16)P is 0 in every
frame. But then the theorem in Section 13.3 says that all four components of (cid:16)P
are 0 in every frame. Therefore, p is conserved. Likewise for the case where one
of the pi is known to be conserved.

13.5 Force and acceleration

Throughout this section, we’ll deal with objects with constant mass, which we’ll
call “particles.” The treatment here can be generalized to cases where the mass
changes (for example, the object is being heated, or extra mass is being dumped
on it), but we won’t concern ourselves with these.

13.5.1 Transformation of forces

Let’s first look at the force 4-vector in the instantaneous inertial frame of a given
particle (frame S(cid:16)). Equation (13.9) gives

(cid:16) = γ

F

(cid:2)

dE(cid:16)
dt

(cid:3)

(cid:16)

, f

= (0, f

(cid:16)).

(13.19)

The first component is zero because dE(cid:16)/dt = d
/dt, and this
contains a factor of v(cid:16), which is zero in this frame. Equivalently, you can just use
Eq. (13.10), with a speed of zero.

1 − v(cid:16)2

m/

(cid:5)

√

(cid:6)

We can now write down two expressions for the 4-force, F, in another frame,
S, in which the particle moves with speed v in the x direction. First, since F

13.5 Force and acceleration

is a 4-vector, it transforms according to Eq. (13.1). We therefore have, using
Eq. (13.19),

= f

But second, from the definition in Eq. (13.9), we also have

F0 = γ dE/dt,
F1 = γ fx,
F2 = γ fy,
F3 = γ fz.

Combining Eqs. (13.20) and (13.21), we obtain

(cid:16)
dE/dt = vf

(cid:16)
fx = f

(cid:16)

/γ ,
y
(cid:16)
fz = f

/γ .

(13.20)

(13.21)

(13.22)

(frame S' )

We therefore recover the results of Section 12.5.3. The longitudinal force is
the same in both frames, but the transverse forces are larger by a factor of γ in
the particle’s frame. Hence, fy/fx decreases by a factor of γ when going from the
particle’s frame to the lab frame (see Fig. 13.2 and Fig. 13.3). And as a bonus,
the F0 component in Eq. (13.22) tells us (after multiplying through by dt) that
dE = fx dx, which is the work–energy result. In other words, using fx ≡ dpx/dt,
we have just derived again the result, dE/dx = fx = dp/dt, that we derived in
Section 12.5.1.

As noted in the first remark in Section 12.5.3, we can’t switch the S and S(cid:16)
frames and write f (cid:16)
= fy/γ . When talking about the forces on a particle, there
y
is indeed one preferred reference frame, namely that of the particle. All frames
are not equivalent here. When forming all of our 4-vectors in Section 13.2, we
explicitly used the dτ , dt, dx, etc., from two events, and it was understood that
these two events were located at the particle.

13.5.2 Transformation of accelerations

The procedure here is similar to the above treatment of the force. Let’s first look
at the acceleration 4-vector in the instantaneous inertial frame of a given particle

(frame S(cid:16)). Equation (13.7) or Eq. (13.8) gives

(cid:16) = (0, a

(cid:16)),

A

(13.23)

because v(cid:16) = 0 in S(cid:16).

We can now write down two expressions for the 4-acceleration, A, in another
frame, S. First, since A is a 4-vector, it transforms according to Eq. (13.1). So we
have, using Eq. (13.23),

But second, from the expression in Eq. (13.8), we also have

A1 = γ 4ax,
A2 = γ 2ay,
A3 = γ 2az.

Combining Eqs. (13.24) and (13.25), we obtain

(The first two equations here are redundant.) We therefore again recover the
results of Section 12.5.3. We see that ay/ax increases by a factor of γ 3/γ 2 = γ
when going from the particle’s frame to the lab frame (see Fig. 13.4 and Fig. 13.5).
This is the opposite of the effect on fy/fx.3 This difference makes it clear that
an f = ma law wouldn’t make any sense. If it were true in one frame, then it
wouldn’t be true in another. Note that the increase in ay/ax in going to the lab
frame is consistent with length contraction, as the “Bead on a rod” example in
Section 12.5.3 showed.

3 In a nutshell, this difference is due to the fact that γ changes with time. When talking about the
acceleration 4-vector, there are γ ’s that we have to differentiate; see Eq. (13.6). This isn’t the case
with the force 4-vector, because the γ is absorbed into the definition of p ≡ γ mv; see Eq. (13.9).
This is what leads to the different powers of γ in Eq. (13.25), in contrast with the identical powers
in Eq. (13.21).

13.6 The form of physical laws

643

Example (Acceleration for circular motion): A particle moves with constant
speed v around the circle x2 + y2 = r2, z = 0, in the lab frame. At the instant
the particle crosses the negative y axis (see Fig. 13.6),
find the 3-acceleration and
4-acceleration in both the lab frame and the instantaneous inertial frame of the particle
(with axes chosen parallel to the lab’s axes).

(cid:16)

Solution: Let the lab frame be S, and let the particle’s instantaneous inertial frame
be S
are related by a Lorentz
transformation in the x direction. The 3-acceleration in S is simply

when it crosses the negative y axis. Then S and S

(cid:16)

a = (0, v2/r, 0).

Fig. 13.6

(13.27)

There’s nothing fancy going on here; the nonrelativistic proof of a = v2/r works
just fine again in the relativistic case. Equation (13.7) or (13.8) then gives the
4-acceleration in S as

A = (0, 0, γ 2v2/r, 0).

(13.28)

y

and S are related
To find the acceleration vectors in S
by a Lorentz transformation in the x direction. This means that the A2 component
of the 4-acceleration is unchanged. So the 4-acceleration in S

is also

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

(cid:16) = A = (0, 0, γ 2v2/r, 0).

In the particle’s frame, a
and γ = 1). Therefore, the 3-acceleration in S

(cid:16)

is

(cid:16)

is the space part of A (using Eq. (13.7) or (13.8), with v = 0

(cid:16) = (0, γ 2v2/r, 0).

(13.30)

Note that our results for a and a

(cid:16)

are consistent with Eq. (13.26).

argument. We have

,

(13.31)

where we have used the fact that transverse lengths are the same in the two frames. ♣

13.6 The form of physical laws

One of the postulates of Special Relativity is that all inertial frames are equivalent.
Therefore, if a physical law holds in one frame, then it must hold in all frames.
Otherwise, it would be possible to differentiate between frames. As noted in

644

4-vectors

the previous section, the statement “f = ma” cannot be a physical law. The
two sides of the equation transform differently when going from one frame to
another, so the statement cannot be true in all frames. If a statement has any
chance of being true in all frames, it must involve only 4-vectors. Consider a
4-vector equation (say, “A = B”) that is true in frame S. Then if we apply to
this equation a Lorentz transformation (call it M) from S to another frame S(cid:16),
we have

A = B

=⇒ MA = MB

=⇒ A

(cid:16) = B

(cid:16)

.

(13.32)

The law is therefore also true in frame S(cid:16). Of course, there are many 4-vector
equations that are simply not true in any frame (for example, F = P, or 2P = 3P).
Only a small set of such equations (for example, F = mA) are true in at least one
frame, and hence in all frames.

Physical laws may also take the form of scalar equations, such as P · P = m2.
A scalar is by definition a quantity that is frame-independent (as we have shown
the inner product to be). So if a scalar statement is true in one inertial frame, then
it is true in all inertial frames. Physical laws may also be higher-rank “tensor”
equations, such as the ones that arise in electromagnetism and General Relativity.
We won’t discuss tensors here, but suffice it to say that they may be thought of
as things built up from 4-vectors. Scalars and 4-vectors are special cases of
tensors.

All of this is exactly analogous to the situation in 3-D space. In Newtonian
mechanics, f = ma is a possible law, because both sides are 3-vectors. But
f = m(2ax, ay, az) is not a possible law, because the right-hand side is not a
3-vector; it depends on which axis you label as the x axis. If a particle has
acceleration a in the eastward direction, and if you happen to pick this as your
x direction, then the force is 2ma eastward. But if you happen to pick eastward
as your y direction, then the force is ma eastward. It makes no sense for a law
to give two different results based on your arbitrary choice of axis labels. An
example of a frame-independent statement (under rotations) is the claim that a
given stick has a length of 2 meters. This is fine, because it involves the norm,
which is a scalar. But if you say that the stick has an x component of 1.7 meters,
then this cannot be true in all frames.

God said to his cosmos directors,
“I’ve added some stringent selectors.
One is the clause
That your physical laws
Shall be written in terms of 4-vectors.”

suppressed the y and z components. In C’s frame, the 4-velocity of B is (γw, γww),
and the 4-velocity of C is (1, 0). The invariance of the inner product implies that

Chapter 14
General Relativity

This will be somewhat of a strange chapter, because we won’t have enough
time to get to the heart of General Relativity (GR).1 But we’ll still be able to
get a flavor of the subject and derive a few interesting GR results. One crucial
idea in GR is the Equivalence Principle. This says that gravity is equivalent to
acceleration. Or in more practical terms, it says that you can’t tell the difference.
We’ll have much to say about this in the sections below. Another crucial concept
in GR is that of coordinate independence: the laws of physics can’t depend on
what coordinate system you choose. This seemingly innocuous statement has
surprisingly far-reaching consequences. However, a discussion of this topic is
one of the many things we won’t have time for. We would need a whole book on
GR to do it justice. But fortunately it’s possible to get a sense of the nature of GR
without having to master such things. This is the route we’ll take in this chapter.

14.1 The Equivalence Principle

Einstein’s Equivalence Principle says that it is impossible to locally distinguish
between gravity and acceleration. This may be stated more precisely in (at least)
three ways.

A

g

B

earth

• Let person A be enclosed in a small box, far from any massive objects, that undergoes
uniform acceleration (say, g). Let person B stand at rest on the earth (see Fig. 14.1).
The Equivalence Principle says that there are no local experiments these two people can
perform that will tell them which of the two settings they are in. The physics of each
setting is the same.

• Let person A be enclosed in a small box that is in free-fall near a planet. Let person B float
freely in space, far away from any massive objects (see Fig. 14.2). The Equivalence
Principle says that there are no local experiments these two people can perform that will
tell them which of the two settings they are in. The physics of each setting is the same.

1 Ten years after his 1905 paper on the Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein completed his General
Theory of Relativity in 1915, collaborating with Marcel Grossmann during the latter part of this
period. David Hilbert also developed many of the final pieces of the theory in parallel with Einstein;
see Medicus (1984). For a wonderful account of other historical developments of the theory, see
Chandrasekhar (1979).

General Relativity

• “Gravitational” mass is equal to (or proportional to) “inertial” mass. Gravitational mass
is the mg that appears in the formula, F = GMmg/r2 ≡ mgg. Inertial mass is the mi that
appears in the formula, F = mia. There is no a-priori reason why these two m’s should
be the same (or proportional). An object that is dropped on the earth has acceleration
a = (mg/mi)g. For all we know, the ratio mg/mi for plutonium might be different from
that for copper. But experiments with various materials have detected no difference in
the ratios. The Equivalence Principle states that the ratios are equal for any type of mass.
This definition of the Equivalence Principle is equivalent to, say, the second one
above for the following reason. Two different masses that start at rest near B will stay
right where they are as they float freely in space. But two different masses that start at
rest near A will stay next to each other if and only if their accelerations are equal, that
is, if and only if the ratio mg/mi is the same for both. If this ratio is different for the
two masses, then they will diverge from each other, which means that it is possible to
distinguish between the two settings.

These statements are all quite believable. Consider the first one, for example.
When standing on the earth, you have to keep your legs firm to avoid falling
down. When standing in the accelerating box, you have to keep your legs firm
to maintain the same position relative to the floor (that is, to avoid “falling
down”). You certainly can’t naively tell the difference between the two scenarios.
The Equivalence Principle says that it’s not just that you’re too inept to figure
out a way to differentiate between them, but instead that there is no possible
local experiment you can perform to tell the difference, no matter how clever
you are.

Remark: Note the inclusion of the words “small box” and “local” above. On the surface of
the earth, the lines of the gravitational force are not parallel; they converge to the center. The
gravitational force also varies with height. Therefore, an experiment performed over a non-
negligible distance (for example, dropping two balls next to each other, and watching them
converge; or dropping two balls on top of each other and watching them diverge) will have
different results from the same experiment in the accelerating box. The Equivalence Principle
says that if your laboratory is small enough, or if the gravitational field is sufficiently uniform,
then the two scenarios look essentially the same. ♣

14.2 Time dilation

The Equivalence Principle has a striking consequence concerning the behavior of
clocks in a gravitational field. It implies that higher clocks run faster than lower
clocks. If someone puts a watch on top of a tower, and if you stand on the ground,
then you will see the watch on the tower tick faster than an identical watch on
your wrist. If the watch on the tower is taken down and you compare it with the
one on your wrist, it will show more time elapsed.2 Likewise, someone standing

2 This is true only if the watch on the tower is kept there for a long enough time (assuming that the
watches show the same time when you start observing), because the movement of the watch when

14.2 Time dilation

651

on top of the tower will see a clock on the ground run slow. To be quantitative
about this, let’s consider the following two scenarios.

• A light source on top of a tower of height h emits flashes at time intervals ts. A receiver
on the ground receives the flashes at time intervals tr (see Fig. 14.3). What is tr in terms
of ts?

• A rocket of length h accelerates with acceleration g. A light source at the front end
emits flashes at time intervals ts. A receiver at the back end receives the flashes at time
intervals tr (see Fig. 14.4). What is tr in terms of ts?

h

g

h

Fig. 14.4

The Equivalence Principle tells us that these two scenarios are exactly the same,
as far as the sources and receivers are concerned. Hence, the relation between tr
and ts must be the same in each. Therefore, to find out what is going on in the
first scenario, we will study the second scenario (because we can figure out how
this one behaves).

Consider an instantaneous inertial frame, S, of the rocket. In this frame, the
rocket is momentarily at rest (at, say, t = 0), and then it accelerates out of the
frame with acceleration g. The following discussion will be made with respect
to the frame S. Consider a series of quick light pulses emitted from the source,
starting at t = 0. The distance the rocket has traveled out of S at time t is gt2/2,
so if we assume that ts is very small, then we may say that many light pulses are
emitted before the rocket moves appreciably. Likewise, the speed of the source,
namely gt, is also very small. We may therefore ignore the motion of the rocket,
as far as the light source is concerned.

However, the light takes a finite time to reach the receiver, and by then the
receiver will be moving. We therefore cannot ignore the motion of the rocket
when dealing with the receiver. The time it takes the light to reach the receiver
is h/c, at which point the receiver has a speed of v = g(h/c). 3 Therefore, by the
usual classical Doppler effect, the time between the received pulses is4

tr =

ts
1 + (v/c) .

(14.1)

it is taken down causes it to run slow, due to the usual special-relativistic time dilation. But the
speeding-up effect due to the height can be made arbitrarily large compared with the slowing-down
effect due to the motion, by simply keeping the watch on the tower for an arbitrarily long time.
3 The receiver moves a tiny bit during this time, so the “h” here should really be replaced by a slightly
smaller distance. But this yields a negligible second-order effect in the small quantity gh/c2, as you
can show. To sum up, the displacement of the source, the speed of the source, and the displacement
of the receiver are all negligible. But the speed of the receiver is quite relevant.

4 Quick proof of the classical Doppler effect (for a moving receiver): As seen in frame S, when the
receiver and a particular pulse meet, the next pulse is a distance cts behind. The receiver and this
next pulse then travel toward each other at relative speed c + v (as measured by someone in S).
The time difference between receptions is therefore tr = cts/(c + v).

Returning to the clock-on-tower scenario, the Equivalence Principle tells us that
an observer on the ground must see the clock on the tower running fast, by a factor
1 + gh/c2. This means that the upper clock really is running fast, compared with
the lower clock.5 That is,

Greetings! Dear brother from Boulder,
I hear that you’ve gotten much older.
And please tell me why
My lower left thigh
Hasn’t aged quite as much as my shoulder!

Note that the gh in Eq. (14.3) is the gravitational potential energy divided
by m.

Remark: You might object to the above derivation, because tr is the time measured by someone
in the inertial frame S. And since the receiver is eventually moving with respect to S, we should
multiply the fr in Eq. (14.2) by the usual special-relativistic time-dilation factor, 1/
1 − (v/c)2
(because the receiver’s clocks are running slow relative to S, so the frequency measured by the
receiver is greater than that measured in S). However, this is a second-order effect in the small
quantity v/c = gh/c2. We already dropped other effects of the same order, so we have no right
to keep this one. Of course, if the leading effect in our final answer turned out to be second
order in v/c, then we would know that our answer was garbage. But the leading effect happens
to be first order, so we can afford to be careless with the second-order effects. ♣

(cid:4)

After a finite time has passed, the frame S will no longer be of any use to us.
But we can always pick a new instantaneous rest frame of the rocket, so we can
repeat the above analysis at any later time. Therefore, the result in Eq. (14.2)
holds at all times.

This gravitational time-dilation effect was first measured by R. Pound and
G. Rebka in 1960. By sending gamma rays both up and down a 22 m tower,
they were able to measure the redshift (that is, the decrease in frequency) at the
top. This was a notable feat indeed, considering that they were able to measure
a frequency shift of gh/c2 (which is only a few parts in 1015) to within 10%
accuracy. In 1964, R. Pound and J. Snider improved the accuracy to 1%.

5 Unlike the situation where two people fly past each other (as with the usual twin paradox), we can
say here that what an observer sees is also what actually is. We can say this because everyone here
is in the same frame. The “turnaround” effect that was present in the twin paradox isn’t present
now. The two clocks can be slowly moved together without anything exciting or drastic happening
to their readings.

14.3 Uniformly accelerating frame

Before reading this section, you should think carefully about the “Break or not
break” problem in Chapter 11 (Problem 11.26). Don’t look at the solution too
soon, because chances are you will change your answer after a few more minutes
of thought. This is a classic problem, so don’t waste it by peeking!

Technically, the uniformly accelerating frame we’ll construct here has nothing
to do with GR. We won’t need to leave the realm of Special Relativity for the
analysis in this section. But the reason we choose to study this special-relativistic
setup in detail is that it shows many similarities to genuine GR situations, such
as black holes.

14.3.1 Uniformly accelerating point particle

In order to understand a uniformly accelerating frame, we first need to understand
a uniformly accelerating point particle. In Section 11.9, we briefly discussed the
motion of a uniformly accelerating particle, that is, one that feels a constant force
in its instantaneous rest frame. We’ll now take a closer look at such a particle. Let
the particle’s instantaneous rest frame be S(cid:16), and let it start at rest in the inertial
frame S. Let its mass be m. We know from Section 12.5.3 that the longitudinal
force is the same in the two frames. Therefore, since it is constant in S(cid:16), it is also
constant in S. Call it f . If we let g ≡ f /m (so g is the proper acceleration felt by
the particle), then in S we have, using the fact that f is constant,

f = dp

=⇒ gt = γ v =⇒ v =

(14.4)

where we have set c = 1. As a double-check, this has the correct behavior for
t → 0 and t → ∞. If you want to keep the c’s in, then (gt)2 becomes (gt/c)2 to
make the units right. Having found the speed in S at time t, the position in S at
time t is given by

Everything has been fairly normal up to this point, but now the fun begins.
Consider a point A on the particle’s hyperbolic worldline at time t. From
Eq. (14.5), A has coordinates

The slope of the line PA is therefore

tA − tP
xA − xP

=

gt(cid:4)

1 + (gt)2

.

(14.9)

Looking at Eq. (14.4), we see that this slope equals the speed v of the particle
at point A. But we know very well that the speed v is the slope of the particle’s
instantaneous x(cid:16) axis; see Eq. (11.47). Therefore, the line PA and the particle’s x(cid:16)
axis are the same line. This holds for any arbitrary time t. So we may say that at
any point along the particle’s worldline, the line PA is the instantaneous x(cid:16) axis
of the particle. Or, said another way, no matter where the particle is, the event
at P is simultaneous with an event located at the particle, as measured in the
instantaneous frame of the particle. In other words, the particle always says that
P happens “now.”6

Here is another strange fact. What is the distance from P to A, as measured
in an instantaneous rest frame, S(cid:16), of the particle? The γ factor between frames
S and S(cid:16) is, using Eq. (14.4), γ =
1 + (gt)2. The distance between P and A in
frame S is xA − xP =
1 + (gt)2 /g. So the distance between P and A in frame
S(cid:16) is (using the Lorentz transformation (cid:16)x = γ ((cid:16)x(cid:16) + v(cid:16)t(cid:16)), with (cid:16)t(cid:16) = 0)

(14.10)

This has the unexpected property of being independent of t. Therefore, not only
do we find that P is always simultaneous with the particle, as measured in the
particle’s instantaneous rest frame; we also find that P is always the same distance
(namely 1/g) away from the particle, in the particle’s frame. This is rather strange.
The particle accelerates away from point P, but it doesn’t get farther away from
it, as measured in its own frame.

Remark: We can give a continuity argument that shows that such a point P must exist. If a
point is close to you, and if you accelerate away from it, then of course you get farther away
from it. Everyday experience is quite valid here. But if a point is sufficiently far away from
you, and if you accelerate away from it, then the at2/2 distance you travel away from it can
easily be compensated by the decrease in distance due to length contraction (brought about by
your newly acquired velocity). This effect grows with distance, so we simply need to pick the

6 The point P is very much like the event horizon of a black hole. Time seems to stand still at P in
this treatment. And if we went more deeply into GR, we would find that time seems to stand still
at the edge of a black hole, too (as viewed by someone far away).

point to be sufficiently far away. What this means is that every time you get out of your chair
and walk to the door, there are stars very far away behind you that get closer to you as you
walk away from them (as measured in your instantaneous rest frame). By continuity, then, there
must exist a point P that remains the same distance from you (in your frame) as you accelerate
away from it. ♣

14.3.2 Uniformly accelerating frame

Let’s now put a collection of uniformly accelerating particles together to make a
uniformly accelerating frame. Our goal will be to create a frame in which the dis-
tances between particles (as measured in any particle’s instantaneous rest frame)
remain constant. Why is this our goal? We know from the “Break or not break”
problem in Chapter 11 that if all the particles accelerate with the same proper
acceleration, g, then the distances (as measured in a particle’s instantaneous rest
frame) grow larger. While this is a perfectly possible frame to construct, it is not
desirable, for the following reason. Einstein’s Equivalence Principle states that
an accelerating frame is equivalent to a frame sitting on, say, the earth. We can
therefore study the effects of gravity by studying an accelerating frame. But if we
want this frame to look anything like the surface of the earth, we certainly can’t
have distances that change over time. We therefore want to construct a static
frame, that is, one in which distances do not change (as measured in the frame).
This will allow us to say that if we enclose the frame in a windowless box, then
for all a person inside knows, he is standing motionless in a static gravitational
field (which has a certain definite form, as we shall see).

Let’s figure out how to construct the frame. We’ll discuss the acceleration
of just two particles here. Others can be added in a similar manner. In the end,
the desired frame as a whole is constructed by accelerating each atom in the
floor of the frame with a specific proper acceleration. From Section 14.3.1, we
already have a particle A that is “centered” around the point P. (This will be our
shorthand notation for “traveling along a branch of a hyperbola whose center
is the point P.”) We claim, for reasons that will become clear, that every other
particle in the frame should also be “centered” around the same point P.

Consider another particle, B. Let a and b be the initial distances from
P to A and B. If both particles are to be centered around P, then their proper
accelerations must be, from Eq. (14.6),

gA = 1
a

,

and

gB = 1
b

.

(14.11)

t

Therefore, in order to have all points in the frame be centered around P, we
simply have to make their proper accelerations inversely proportional to their
initial distances from P.

Why do we want every particle to be centered around P? Consider two
events, EA and EB, such that P, EA, and EB are collinear in Fig. 14.6. From
Section 14.3.1, we know that the line PEAEB is the x(cid:16) axis for both particle

656

General Relativity

A and particle B, at the positions shown. We also know that A is always a distance
a from P, and B is always a distance b from P (in their frame). Combining these
facts with the fact that A and B measure their distances along the x(cid:16) axis of the
same frame (at the events shown in the figure), we see that both A and B measure
the distance between them to be b − a. This is independent of t, so A and B
measure a constant distance between them. We have therefore constructed our
desired static frame. This frame is often called a “Rindler space.” If a person
walks around in the frame, he will think that he lives in a static world where the
acceleration due to gravity takes the form g(z) ∝ 1/z, where z is the distance to
a certain magical point which is located at the end of the known “universe.”

What if a person releases himself from the accelerating frame, so that he
forever sails through space at constant speed? His view is that he is falling. He
falls past the “magical point” P in a finite proper time, because the hyperbolic
worldline of a point infinitesimally close to P is essentially the asymptote of all
the hyperbolas, and the person’s straight-line worldline intersects this line. But
his friends who are still in the frame will see him take an infinitely long time to
get to P, because the x(cid:16) axes of points in the frame never quite swing up to the
asymptote, even after an infinite amount of time. So the “now” line of any point
in the frame never quite passes through the event where the person crosses the
asymptote. This is similar to the situation with a black hole. An outside observer
will see it take an infinitely long time for a falling person to reach the “boundary”
of a black hole, even though it takes a finite proper time for the person.

Our analysis shows that A and B feel different proper accelerations, because
a (cid:13)= b. There is no way to construct a static frame where all points feel the
same proper acceleration, so it is impossible to mimic a constant gravitational
field (over a finite distance) by using an accelerating frame. The problems and
exercises for this chapter offer plenty of opportunity for you to play around with
the properties of our uniformly accelerating frame.

14.4 Maximal-proper-time principle

The maximal-proper-time principle in General Relativity says: Given two events
in spacetime, a particle under the influence of only gravity takes the path in
spacetime that maximizes the proper time. For example, if you throw a ball from
given coordinates (r1, t1), and it lands at given coordinates (r2, t2), then the claim
is that the ball takes the path that maximizes its proper time.7

This is clear for a freely moving ball in outer space, far from any massive
objects. The ball travels at constant speed from one point to another, and we

7 The principle is actually the “stationary-proper-time principle,” because as with the Lagrangian
formalism in Chapter 6, any type of stationary point (a maximum, minimum, or saddle point) is
allowed. But although we were very careful about stating things properly in Chapter 6, we’ll be a
little sloppy here and just use the word “maximum,” because that’s what it will generally turn out
to be in the situations we’ll look at. However, see Problem 14.8.

14.4 Maximal-proper-time principle

657

know that this constant-speed motion is the motion with the maximal proper
time. This is true because a ball, A, moving at constant speed sees the clock
on any other ball, B, running slow due to the special-relativistic time dilation,
if there is a relative speed between them. (We’re assuming that B’s nonuni-
form velocity is caused by a nongravitational force acting on it.) B therefore
shows a shorter elapsed time. This argument doesn’t work the other way around,
because B isn’t in an inertial frame and therefore can’t use the special-relativistic
time-dilation result.

Consistency with Newtonian physics
The maximal-proper-time principle sounds like a plausible idea, but we already
know from Chapter 6 that the path an object takes is the one that yields a stationary
(T − V ). We must therefore demonstrate that the
value of the classical action,
maximal-proper-time principle reduces to the stationary-action principle, in the
limit of small velocities. If this weren’t the case, then we’d have to throw out the
maximal-proper-time principle.

(cid:17)

Consider a ball thrown vertically on the earth. Assume that the initial and final
coordinates are fixed to be (y1, t1) and (y2, t2). Our plan will be to assume that
the maximal-proper-time principle holds, and to then show that this leads to the
stationary-action principle. Before being quantitative, let’s get a qualitative idea
about what’s going on with the ball. There are two competing effects, as far as
maximizing the proper time goes. On one hand, the ball wants to climb very
high, because its clock will run faster there, due to the GR time dilation. But on
the other hand, if it climbs very high, then it must move very fast to get there
(because the total time, t2 − t1, is fixed), and this will make its clock run slow,
due to the SR time dilation. So there’s a tradeoff. Let’s now look quantitatively
at the implications of this tradeoff. The goal is to maximize

τ =

dτ .

(14.12)

Due to the motion of the ball, we have the usual time dilation, dτ =
(cid:4)
1 − v2/c2 dt. But due to the height of the ball, we also have the gravitational

time dilation, dτ = (1 + gy/c2) dt. Combining these effects gives8

8 This result is technically incorrect, because the two effects are intertwined in a somewhat more
complicated manner (see Exercise 14.20). But it’s valid up to first order in v2/c2 and gy/c2, which
is all we’re concerned with here.

which is the classical action, as desired. For a one-dimensional gravitational
problem such as this one, the action is always a (global) minimum, and the
proper time is always a (global) maximum, as you can show by considering the
second-order change in the action (see Exercise 14.23, which is the same as
Exercise 6.32).

In retrospect, it isn’t surprising that the kinetic energy here works out. The
factor of 1/2 comes about in exactly the same way as in the derivation in
Eq. (12.9), where we showed that the relativistic form of energy reduces to
the familiar Newtonian expression. As far as the potential energy goes, the gy
here can be traced to the acceleration times a certain time, where this time is pro-
portional to the distance; see the paragraph before Eq. (14.1). This yields (when
multiplied by mc2) the usual force times distance expression for the potential.

(cid:17)

The maximal-proper-time principle here is equivalent to the statement that
the action for the Lagrangian we introduced near the end of Section 12.1 is
S = − mc
dτ . In both cases we want to extremize the integral of the proper
time. In Section 12.1 we dealt only with a free particle, so the treatment here
is a little more general because it includes the effect of gravity. But note that
although Eq. (14.15) has the obvious interpretation of including the gravitational
potential, the starting point in Eq. (14.12) makes no mention of a gravitational
force. In the present treatment, gravity shouldn’t be thought of as a force, but
instead as something that affects the proper time.9

14.5 Twin paradox revisited

Let’s take another look at the standard twin paradox, this time from the perspective
of General Relativity. We should emphasize that GR is by no means necessary
for an understanding of the original formulation of the paradox (the first scenario
below). We were able to solve it in Section 11.3.2, after all. The present discussion
is given simply to show that the answer to an alternative formulation (the second

geometry, can lead to General Relativity, see Rindler (1994).

scenario below) is consistent with what we’ve learned about GR. Consider the
two following twin-paradox setups.

• Twin A floats freely in outer space. Twin B flies past A in a spaceship, with speed v0 (see
Fig. 14.7). At the instant they are next to each other, they both set their clocks to zero. At
this same instant, B turns on the reverse thrusters of his spaceship and decelerates with
proper deceleration g. B eventually reaches a farthest point from A and then accelerates
back toward A, finally passing him with speed v0 again. When they are next to each
other, they compare the readings on their clocks. Which twin is younger?

• Twin B stands on the earth. Twin A is thrown upward with speed v0 (let’s say he is
fired from a cannon in a hole in the ground; see Fig. 14.8). At the instant they are next
to each other,
they both set their clocks to zero. A rises up and then falls back down,
finally passing B with speed v0 again. When they are next to each other, they compare
the readings on their clocks. Which twin is younger?

The first scenario is easily solved using Special Relativity. Since A is in an
inertial frame, he can apply the results of Special Relativity. In particular, he sees
B’s clock run slow, due to the usual special-relativistic time dilation. Therefore,
B ends up younger at the end. B cannot use the reverse reasoning, because she is
not in an inertial frame.

What about the second scenario? The key point to realize is that the Equiva-
lence Principle says that these two scenarios are exactly the same (ignoring the
nonuniformity of the earth’s gravitational force), as far as the twins are con-
cerned. Twin B has no way of knowing whether she is in a spaceship accelerating
at g or on the surface of the earth. And A has no way of knowing whether he is
floating freely in outer space or in free-fall in a gravitational field.10 We therefore
conclude that B must be younger in the second scenario, too.

At first glance, this seems incorrect, because in the second scenario, B is
sitting motionless while A is the one who is moving. It seems that B should see
A’s clock running slow, due to the usual special-relativistic time dilation, and
hence A should be younger. This reasoning is incorrect because it fails to take
into account the gravitational time dilation. The fact of the matter is that A is
higher in the gravitational field, and therefore his clock runs faster. This effect
does indeed win out over the special-relativistic time dilation, and A ends up
older. You can explicitly show this in Problem 14.11.

The reasoning in this section yields another way to conclude that the Equiva-
lence Principle implies that higher clocks must run faster (in one way or another).
The Equivalence Principle implies that A must be older in the second scenario,
which means that there must be some height effect that makes A’s clock run

10 As mentioned in Section 14.1, this fact is made possible by the equivalence of inertial and gravi-
tational mass. Were it not for this, different parts of A’s body would want to accelerate at different
rates in the gravitational field in the second scenario. This would certainly clue him in to the fact
that he wasn’t floating freely in space.

fast (fast enough to win out over the special-relativistic time dilation). But it
takes some more work to show that the factor is actually 1 + gh/c2. Note that
the fact that A is older is consistent with the maximal-proper-time principle. In
both scenarios, A is under the influence of only gravity (zero gravity in the first
scenario), whereas B feels a normal force from either the spaceship’s floor or
the ground.

14.1. Airplane’s speed *

A plane flies at constant height h. What should its speed be so that an
observer on the ground sees the plane’s clock tick at the same rate as a
ground clock? (Assume v (cid:4) c.)

14.2. Clock on a tower **

A clock starts on the ground and then moves up a tower at constant
speed v. It sits on top of the tower for a time T and then descends at
constant speed v. If the tower has height h, how long should the clock
sit at the top so that it comes back showing the same time as a clock
that remained on the ground? (Assume v (cid:4) c.)

14.3. Circular motion **

B moves at speed v (with v (cid:4) c) in a circle of radius r around A, far
from any masses. By what fraction does B’s clock run slower than A’s?
Calculate this in three ways. Work in:

(a) A’s frame.
(b) The frame whose origin is B and whose axes remain parallel to

an inertial set of axes.

(c) The rotating frame that is centered at A and rotates with the same

frequency as B.

14.4. More circular motion **

A and B move at speed v (v (cid:4) c) in a circle of radius r, at diametrically
opposite points, far from any masses. They both see their clocks ticking
at the same rate. Show this in three ways. Work in:

(a) The lab frame (the inertial frame whose origin is the center of

the circle).

(b) The frame whose origin is B and whose axes remain parallel to

an inertial set of axes.

(c) The rotating frame that is centered at the origin and rotates with

the same frequency as A and B.

14.5. Accelerator’s point of view ***

Arocket starts at rest relative to a planet, a distance (cid:2) away. It accelerates
toward the planet with proper acceleration g. Let τ and t be the readings
on the rocket’s and planet’s clocks, respectively.

(a) Show that when the astronaut’s clock reads τ , he observes the
rocket–planet distance x (as measured in his instantaneous
inertial frame) to be given by

1 + gx = 1 + g(cid:2)

cosh(gτ ) .

(b) Show that when the astronaut’s clock reads τ , he observes the

time t on the planet’s clock to be given by

gt = (1 + g(cid:2)) tanh(gτ ).

The results from Exercises 14.16 and 14.20 will be useful here.

14.6. Getting way ahead ****

A rocket with proper length L accelerates from rest, with proper accel-
eration g (where gL (cid:4) c2). Clocks are located at the front and back
of the rocket. If we look at this setup in the rocket frame, then the GR
time-dilation effect tells us that the times on the two clocks are related
by tf = (1 + gL/c2)tb. Therefore, if we look at things in the ground
frame, then the times on the two clocks are related by

tf = tb

where the last term comes from the SR “rear clock ahead” result. Derive
the above relation by working entirely in the ground frame.11

14.7. Lv/c2 revisited **

You stand at rest relative to a rocket that has synchronized clocks at its
ends. It is then arranged for you and the rocket to move with relative
speed v. A reasonable question to ask is: As viewed by you, what is the
difference in readings on the clocks located at the ends of the rocket?

11 You might find this relation surprising, because it implies that the front clock will eventually be an
arbitrarily large time ahead of the back clock, in the ground frame. (The subtractive Lv/c2 term is
bounded by L/c and will therefore eventually become negligible compared with the additive, and
unbounded, (gL/c2)tb term.) But both clocks seem to be doing basically the same thing relative
to the ground frame, so how can they end up differing by so much? Your job is to find out.

662

General Relativity

It turns out that this question cannot be answered without further
information on how you and the rocket got to be moving with rela-
tive speed v. There are two basic ways this relative speed can come
about. The rocket can accelerate while you sit there, or you can accel-
erate while the rocket sits there. Using the results from Problems 14.5
and 14.6, explain what the answers to the above question are in these
two cases.

Section 14.4: Maximal-proper-time principle

14.8. Circling the earth **

Clock A sits at rest on the earth, and clock B circles the earth in an
orbit that skims along the ground. Both A and B are essentially at the
same radius, so the GR time-dilation effect yields no difference in their
times. But B is moving relative to A, so A sees B running slow, due
to the usual SR time-dilation effect. The orbiting clock, B, therefore
shows a smaller elapsed proper time each time it passes A. In other
words, the clock under the influence of only gravity (B) does not show
the maximal proper time, in conflict with what we have been calling
the maximal-proper-time principle. Explain.

Section 14.5: Twin paradox revisited

14.9. Twin paradox *

A spaceship travels at speed v (v (cid:4) c) to a distant star. Upon reach-
ing the star, it decelerates and then accelerates back up to speed v
in the opposite direction (uniformly, and in a short time compared
with the total journey time). By what fraction does the traveler age
less than her twin on the earth? (Ignore the gravity from the earth.)
Work in:

(a) The earth frame.
(b) The spaceship frame.

14.10. Twin paradox again **

(a) Answer part (b) of the previous problem, except now let the
spaceship turn around by moving in a small semicircle while
maintaining speed v.

(b) Answer part (b) of the previous problem, except now let the
spaceship turn around by moving in an arbitrary manner. The
only constraints are that the turnaround is done quickly (com-
pared with the total journey time) and that it is contained in a
small region of space (compared with the earth–star distance).

(a) In the first scenario in Section 14.5, calculate the ratio of B’s
elapsed time to A’s, in terms of v0 and g. Work in A’s frame.
Assume v0 (cid:4) c, and drop high-order terms.

(b) Do the same for the second scenario in Section 14.5. Do this
from scratch using the time dilations, and then check that
your answer agrees (within the accuracy of the calculations)
with part (a), as the Equivalence Principle demands. Work in
B’s frame.

14.12. Driving on a hill *

You drive up and down a hill of height h at constant speed. The hill is
in the shape of an isosceles triangle with altitude h. What should your
speed be so that you age the same amount as someone standing at the
base of the hill? (Assume v (cid:4) c.)

14.13. Lv/c2 and gh/c2

*

The familiar special-relativistic “rear clock ahead” result, Lv/c2,
looks rather similar to the gh/c2 term in the GR time-dilation result,
Eq. (14.3). Imagine standing on the ground near the front of a train of
length L. For small v, devise a thought experiment that explains how
the Lv/c2 result follows from the gh/c2 result.

14.14. Both points of view **

A and B are initially a distance L apart, at rest with respect to each
other. At a given time, B accelerates toward A with constant proper
acceleration a. Assume aL (cid:4) c2.

(a) Working in A’s frame, calculate the difference in readings on A’s

and B’s clocks when B reaches A.

(b) Do the same by working in B’s frame, and show that the
result agrees (neglecting higher-order effects) with the result
from part (a).

14.15. Opposite circular motion ****

A and B move at speed v (v (cid:4) c) in opposite directions around a circle
of radius r (so they pass each other after each half-revolution), far from
any masses. They both see their two clocks ticking, on average, at the
same rate. That is, if they compare their clocks each time they pass

664

General Relativity

each other, both clocks show the same time elapsed. Demonstrate this
in three ways. Work in:

(a) The lab frame (the inertial frame whose origin is the center of

the circle).

(b) The frame whose origin is B and whose axes remain parallel to

an inertial set of axes.

(c) The rotating frame that is centered at the origin and rotates along
with B. This part is very tricky; the solution is given in Cranor
et al. (2000), but don’t peek too soon.

Section 14.3: Uniformly accelerating frame

14.16. Various quantities *

A particle starts at rest and accelerates with proper acceleration g. Let τ
be the time on the particle’s clock. Starting with the v from Eq. (14.4),
use time dilation to show that the time t in the original inertial frame,
the speed of the particle, and the associated γ factor are given by (with
c = 1)

gt = sinh(gτ ),

v = tanh(gτ ),

γ = cosh(gτ ).

(14.19)

14.17. Using rapidity *

Another way to derive the v in Eq. (14.4) is to use the v = tanh(gτ )
rapidity result (where τ is the particle’s proper time) from Section 11.9.
Use time dilation to show that this implies gt = sinh(gτ ), which then
implies Eq. (14.4).

14.18. Speed in an accelerating frame *

In the setup in Problem 14.5, use Eq. (14.16) to find the speed of the
planet in the rocket’s accelerating frame, |dx/dτ |, as a function of τ .
What is the maximum value of this speed, in terms of g and the initial
distance (cid:2)?

14.19. Redshift, blueshift **

We found in Section 14.2 that a clock at the rear of a rocket sees a
clock at the front run fast by a factor 1 + gh/c2. However, we ignored
higher-order effects in 1/c2, so for all we know, we found only the
first term in the Taylor series, and the factor is actually something like
egh/c2

or perhaps 1 + ln(1 + gh/c2).

(a) For the uniformly accelerating frame in Section 14.3.2, show
that the factor is in fact exactly 1 + grh/c2, where gr is the
acceleration of the rear of the rocket. Show this by lining up a
series of clocks and looking at the successive factors between
them. (Hint: Take the log of the product of the factors.) The

14.7 Exercises

665

overall factor takes a very nice form when written in terms of
the a and b in Fig. 14.6; what is it?

(b) By the same reasoning as in part (a), it follows that the front
clock sees the rear clock run slow by a factor 1 − gf h/c2,
where gf is the acceleration of the front. Show explicitly that
(1 + grh/c2)(1 − gf h/c2) = 1, as must be the case, because
a clock can’t gain time with respect to itself (and because the
two clocks are at rest in the frame of the rocket; this reasoning
wouldn’t apply to two clocks flying past each other).

14.20. Gravity and speed combined **

In the spirit of Problem 11.25 (“Acceleration and redshift”), use a
Minkowski diagram to solve this problem. A rocket accelerates with
proper acceleration g toward a planet. As measured in the instantaneous
inertial frame of the rocket, the planet is a distance x away and moves
at speed v. Everything is in one dimension here. As measured in the
accelerating frame of the rocket, show that the planet’s clock runs at a
rate (with c = 1),

(cid:4)

dtp = dtr(1 + gx)

1 − v2 ,

(14.20)

and show that the planet’s speed is

V = (1 + gx)v.

(14.21)

Note that if we combine these two results and eliminate v, and if we
then invoke the Equivalence Principle, we arrive at the result that a
clock moving at speed V at height h in a gravitational field is seen by
someone on the ground to run at a rate (putting the c’s back in),

14.21. Length contraction **

A pencil points directly at you. From some distance away from it,
you start at rest and accelerate toward it with acceleration a. After
a time t, the pencil is length contracted in your frame by a factor
(cid:4)
1 − v2/c2 ≈ 1 − (at)2/2c2, for small t (more precisely, for at (cid:4) c).
But the only way the pencil can shrink is for the back to move faster
than the front, as measured by you in your accelerating frame. Using
Eq. (14.21), show that the contraction factor works out as it should, for
small t.

14.22. Accelerating stick’s length **

Consider a uniformly accelerating frame consisting of a stick, the ends
of which have worldlines given by the curves in Fig. 14.6 (so the stick

666

General Relativity

(cid:4)

has proper length b − a). At time t in the lab frame, we know from
Eqs. (14.5) and (14.6) that a point that undergoes acceleration g has
1 + (gt)2/g relative to the point P in Fig. 14.6. An observer
position
in the original inertial frame sees the stick being length contracted by
different factors along its length, because different points move with
different speeds (at a given time in the original frame). Show, by doing
the appropriate integral, that the inertial observer concludes that the
stick always has proper length b − a.

Section 14.4: Maximal-proper-time principle

14.23. Maximum proper time *

Show that the stationary value of the gravitational action in Eq. (14.15)
is always a minimum (which means that the proper time is always a
maximum). Do this by considering a function, y(t) = y0(t) + ξ(t),
where y0 is the path that yields the stationary value, and ξ is a small
variation.

Section 14.5: Twin paradox revisited

14.24. Symmetric twin nonparadox **

Two twins travel toward each other, both at speed v (v (cid:4) c) with
respect to an inertial observer. They synchronize their clocks when they
pass each other. They travel to stars located at positions ±(cid:2), and then
decelerate and accelerate back up to speed v in the opposite direction
(uniformly, and in a short time compared with the total journey time).
In the frame of the inertial observer, it is clear (by symmetry) that both
twins age the same amount by the time they pass each other again.
Reproduce this result by working in the frame of one of the twins.

An observer on the ground sees the plane’s clock run slow by a factor
due to SR time dilation. But he also sees it run fast by a factor (1 + gh/c2) due to GR
time dilation. We therefore want the product of these two factors to equal 1. Using
the standard Taylor-series approximation for slow speeds in the first factor, we find

Our goal is to balance this time loss with the time gain due to the GR time-dilation

But we must not forget the increase in time due to the height gained while the clock
is in motion. During its motion, the clock’s average height is h/2. The total time in
motion is 2h/v, so the GR time gain while the clock is moving is (we can use the
average height here, because the GR effect is linear in h)

14.3. Circular motion

(a) In A’s frame, there is only the SR time-dilation effect. A sees B move at speed
1 − v2/c2. And since v (cid:4) c, we may

v, so B’s clock runs slow by a factor of
use the Taylor series to approximate this as 1 − v2/2c2.

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

(b) In this frame, there are both SR and GR time-dilation effects. A moves at speed
v with respect to B in this frame, so the SR effect is that A’s clock runs slow by a
1 − v2/c2 ≈ 1−v2/2c2. But B undergoes an acceleration of a = v2/r
factor
toward A, so for all B knows, he lives in a world where the acceleration due
to gravity is v2/r. A is “higher” in the gravitational field, so the GR effect is
that A’s clock runs fast by a factor 1 + ar/c2 = 1 + v2/c2. Multiplying the SR
and GR effects together, we find (to lowest order) that A’s clock runs fast by a
factor 1 + v2/2c2. This means (to lowest order) that B’s clock runs slow by a
factor 1 − v2/2c2, in agreement with the answer to part (a).

(c) In this frame, there is no relative motion between A and B, so there is only
the GR time-dilation effect. The gravitational field (that is, the centripetal
acceleration) at a distance x from the center is gx = xω2. Imagine lining up a
series of clocks along a radius, with separation dx. Then the GR time-dilation
result tells us that each clock loses a fraction gx dx/c2 = xω2 dx/c2 of time
relative to the next clock inward. Integrating these fractions from x = 0 to
x = r shows that B’s clock loses a fraction r2ω2/2c2 = v2/2c2, compared
with A’s clock. This agrees with the results in parts (a) and (b).

Remark:
If you want to imagine an analogous line of clocks in part (b), you
can imagine lining a stick with them, with B at one end of the stick. The sensible
thing to do with the stick is to have it be motionless with respect to B’s frame
(as the line of clocks was in part (c)). But this means that the stick doesn’t rotate
with respect to the inertial axes, because B’s axes don’t rotate. So all of the

668

General Relativity

clocks feel the same acceleration rω2 = v2/r, in contrast with the decreasing
accelerations in part (c). The integral of all the fractions therefore doesn’t pick
up the factor of 2 as it did in part (c), and so we simply end up with v2/c2. The
SR effect then arises in part (b) because A is flying past the clock on the other
end of the stick, whereas in part (c) A was at rest. ♣

14.4. More circular motion

(a) In the lab frame, the situation is symmetric with respect to A and B. Therefore,
if A and B are decelerated in a symmetric manner and brought together, their
clocks must read the same time.

Assume (in the interest of obtaining a contradiction) that A sees B’s clock
run slow. Then after an arbitrarily long time, A will see B’s clock an arbitrarily
large time behind his. Now bring A and B to a stop. There is no possible way
that the stopping motion can make B’s clock gain an arbitrarily large amount of
time, as seen by A. This is true because everything takes place in a finite region
of space, so there is an upper bound on the GR time-dilation effect (because
it behaves like gh/c2, and h is bounded). Therefore, A will end up seeing
B’s clock reading less. This contradicts the result of the previous paragraph.
Likewise for the case where A sees B’s clock run fast.

Remark: Note how this problem differs from the problem where A and B move
with equal speeds directly away from each other, and then reverse directions
and head back to meet up again. For this new “linear” problem, the symmetry
reasoning in the first paragraph above still holds, so A and B will indeed have
the same clock readings when they meet up again. But the reasoning in the
second paragraph does not hold (it had better not, because each person does
not see the other person’s clock running at the same rate). The error is that
in this linear scenario, the experiment is not contained in a small region of
space, so the turning-around effects of order gh/c2 become arbitrarily large
as the time of travel becomes arbitrarily large, because h grows with time
(see Problem 14.9). ♣

(cid:4)

(b) In this frame, there are both SR and GR time-dilation effects. A moves at speed
2v with respect to B in this frame (we don’t need to use the relativistic velocity-
addition formula, because v (cid:4) c), so the SR effect is that A’s clock runs slow
1 − (2v)2/c2 ≈ 1 − 2v2/c2. But B undergoes an acceleration
by a factor
of a = v2/r toward A, so the GR effect is that A’s clock runs fast by a factor
1 + a(2r)/c2 = 1 + 2v2/c2 (because they are separated by a distance 2r).
Multiplying the SR and GR effects together, we find (to lowest order) that the
two clocks run at the same rate.

(c) In this frame, there is no relative motion between A and B, so there is only (at
most) the GR effect. But A and B are both at the same gravitational potential,
because they are at the same radius. Therefore, they both see the clocks running
at the same rate. If you want, you can line up a series of clocks along the
diameter between A and B, as we did along a radius in part (c) of Problem 14.3.
The clocks will gain time as you march in toward the center, and then lose
the same amount of time as you march back out to the diametrically opposite
point.

14.5. Accelerator’s point of view

(a) First solution: Equation (14.5) says that the distance traveled by the rocket
(as measured in the original inertial frame), as a function of the time in the
inertial frame, is

x = (cid:2) − 1

(14.28)

The rocket observer sees this length contracted by a factor γ . Using the
(cid:4)
1 + (gt)2 = cosh(gτ ). So the rocket–
result of Exercise 14.16, we have γ =
planet distance, as measured in the instantaneous inertial frame of the

terms of τ , we have (with c = 1)

(b) Equation (14.20) says that the planet’s clock runs fast (or slow) according to

dt = dτ (1 + gx)

1 − v2.

14.6. Getting way ahead

The explanation of why the two clocks show different times in the ground frame is the
following. The rocket becomes increasingly length contracted in the ground frame,
which means that the front end isn’t traveling quite as fast as the back end. Therefore,
the time-dilation factor for the front clock isn’t as large as that for the back clock. So
the front clock loses less time relative to the ground, and hence ends up ahead of the
back clock. Of course, it’s not at all obvious that everything works out quantitatively
and that the front clock eventually ends up an arbitrarily large time ahead of the back
clock. In fact, it’s quite surprising that this is the case, because the above difference
in speeds is very small. But let’s now show that the above explanation does indeed
account for the difference in the clock readings.

Let the back of the rocket be located at position x. Then the front is located at
1 − v2, due to the length contraction. Taking the time derivatives of

position x + L

General Relativity

the two positions, we see that the speeds of the back and front are (with v ≡ dx/dt)12

vb = v,

and

vf = v(1 − Lγ ˙v).

(14.34)

If we assume that the back is the part that accelerates at g (it doesn’t matter which
point we pick, to leading order), then we can just invoke the result in Eq. (14.4),

vb = v =

gt(cid:4)

1 + (gt)2

,

(14.35)

where t is the time in the ground frame. Having written down v, we must now find
the γ factors associated with the speeds of the front and back. The γ factor associated
with the speed of the back, namely v, is

γ b =

1√

1 − v2

(cid:15)

=

1 + (gt)2 .

(14.36)

The γ factor associated with the speed of the front, vf = v(1 − Lγ ˙v), is a bit
more complicated. We must first calculate ˙v. From Eq. (14.35), we obtain ˙v =
g/(1 + g2t2)3/2, which gives

vf = v(1 − Lγ ˙v) =

The γ factor (or rather 1/γ , which is what we’ll be concerned with) associated with
this speed is given as follows. In the first line below, we ignore the higher-order (gL)2
term, because it is really (gL/c2)2, and we are assuming that gL/c2 is small. And in

We can now calculate the time that each clock shows, at time t in the ground frame.

12 Since these two speeds aren’t equal, there is an ambiguity concerning which speed we should use
1 − v2. Equivalently, the rocket doesn’t have a single inertial
in the length-contraction factor,
frame that describes all of it. But you can show that any differences arising from this ambiguity
are of higher order in gL/c2 than we need to be concerned with.

(14.44)

as we wanted to show. If we look at this calculation from the reverse point of view,
we see that by using only Special Relativity concepts, we have demonstrated that
someone at the back of a rocket sees a clock at the front running fast by a factor
(1 + gL/c2). There are, however, much easier ways of deriving this, as we saw in
Section 14.2 and in Problem 11.25 (“Acceleration and redshift”).

14.7. Lv/c2 revisited

Consider first the case where the rocket accelerates while you sit there. Problem
14.6 is exactly relevant here, and it tells us that in your frame the clock readings are
related by

tf = tb

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

1 + gL
c2

− Lv
c2 .

(14.45)

You will eventually see the front clock an arbitrarily large time ahead of the back
clock. But note that for small times (before things become relativistic), the standard
Newtonian result, v ≈ gtb, is valid, so we have

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

tb + Lv
c2

− Lv
c2

= tb.

tf ≈

(14.46)

So in this setup where the rocket is the one that accelerates, both clocks show essen-
tially the same time near the start. This makes sense; both clocks have essentially the
same speed at the beginning, so to lowest order their γ factors are the same, so the
clocks run at the same rate. But eventually the front clock will get ahead of the back
clock.

Now consider the case where you accelerate while the rocket sits there. Problem
14.5 is relevant here, if we let the rocket in that problem now become you, and if we
let two planets a distance L apart become the two ends of the rocket. The times you
observe on the front and back clocks on the rocket are then, using Eq. (14.33) and
assuming that you are accelerating toward the rocket,

gtf = (1 + g(cid:2)) tanh(gτ ),

and

gtb =

(cid:5)

(cid:6)

1 + g((cid:2) + L)

tanh(gτ ).

(14.47)

But from Exercise 14.16, we know that your speed relative to the rocket is v =
tanh(gτ ). Equation (14.47) therefore gives tb = tf + Lv, or tb = tf + Lv/c2 with the
c2. So in this case we arrive at the standard Lv/c2 “rear clock ahead” result.

The point here is that in this second case, the clocks are synchronized in the rocket
frame, and this is the assumption that went into our derivation of the Lv/c2 result in
Chapter 11. In the first case above where the rocket accelerates, the clocks are not
synchronized in the rocket frame (except right at the start), so it isn’t surprising that
we don’t obtain the Lv/c2 result.

General Relativity

14.8. Circling the earth

This is one setup where we really need to use the correct term, stationary-proper-time
principle. It turns out that B’s path yields a saddle point for the proper time. The value
at this saddle point is less than A’s proper time, but this is irrelevant, because we care
only about local stationary points, not about global extrema.

To show that we have a saddle point, we must show that (1) the differences in the
proper time are second order, and (2) there exist nearby paths that give both a larger
and a smaller proper time. The first of these is true because the first-order differences
vanish due to the fact that the path satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equations for the
Lagrangian in Eq. (14.15), because the path is indeed a physical one.

The second is true because the proper time can be made smaller by having B speed
up and slow down. This will cause a net increase in the time-dilation effect as viewed
by A, thereby yielding a smaller proper time.13 And the proper time can be made
larger by having B take a nearby path that doesn’t quite form a great circle on the
earth. (Imagine the curve traced out by a rubber band that has just begun to slip away
from a great-circle position.) This path is shorter, so B won’t have to travel as fast to
get back in a given time, so the time-dilation effect will be smaller as viewed by A,
thereby yielding a larger proper time.

14.9. Twin paradox

(cid:4)

(a) In the earth frame, the spaceship travels at speed v for essentially the whole
1 − v2/c2 ≈ 1 − v2/2c2.
time. Therefore, the traveler ages less by a fraction
The fractional loss of time is thus v2/2c2. The time-dilation effect is different
during the short turning-around period, but this is negligible.

(b) Let the distance to the star be (cid:2), as measured in the frame of the earth (but the
difference in lengths in the two frames is negligible in this problem), and let the
turnaround take a time T . Then the given information says that T (cid:4) (2(cid:2))/v.
During the constant-speed part of the trip, the traveler sees the earth clock
1 − v2/c2 ≈ 1 − v2/2c2. The time for this
running slow by a fraction
constant-speed part is (essentially) 2(cid:2)/v, so the earth clock loses a time of
(v2/2c2)(2(cid:2)/v) = v(cid:2)/c2.

(cid:4)

v

r

Fig. 14.9

However, during the turnaround time, the spaceship is accelerating toward
the earth, so the traveler sees the earth clock running fast, due to the GR time
dilation. The magnitude of the acceleration is a = 2v/T , because the spaceship
goes from velocity v to −v in time T . The earth clock therefore runs fast by a
factor 1 + a(cid:2)/c2 = 1 + 2v(cid:2)/Tc2. This happens for a time T , so the earth clock
gains a time of (2v(cid:2)/Tc2)T = 2v(cid:2)/c2.

Combining the results of the previous two paragraphs, we see that the
earth clock gains a time of 2v(cid:2)/c2 − v(cid:2)/c2 = v(cid:2)/c2. This is a fraction
(v(cid:2)/c2)/(2(cid:2)/v) = v2/2c2 of the total time, in agreement with part (a).

14.10. Twin paradox again

(a) The only difference between this problem and the previous one is the nature
of the turnaround, so all we need to show here is that the traveler still sees the
earth clock gain a time of 2v(cid:2)/c2 during the turnaround.

Let the radius of the semicircle be r. Then the magnitude of the acceleration
is a = v2/r. Let θ be the angle shown in Fig. 14.9. For a given θ , the earth is at

13 This is true for the same reason that a person who travels at constant speed in a straight line
between two points shows a larger proper time than a second person who speeds up and slows
down. This follows directly from SR time dilation, as viewed by the first person. If you want,
you can imagine unrolling B’s circular orbit into a straight line, and then invoke the result just
mentioned. As far as SR time-dilation effects from clock A’s point of view go, it doesn’t matter if
the circle is unrolled into a straight line.

a height of essentially (cid:2) cos θ in the gravitational field felt by the spaceship. The
fractional time that the earth gains while the traveler is at an angle θ is therefore
ah/c2 = (v2/r)((cid:2) cos θ)/c2. Integrating this over the time of the turnaround,
and using dt = r dθ/v, we see that the earth gains the desired time of

(b) Let the acceleration vector at a given instant be a, and let (cid:7) be the vector from
the spaceship to the earth. Note that since the turnaround is done in a small
region of space, (cid:7) is essentially constant here. The earth is at a height of ˆa · (cid:7)
in the gravitational field felt by the spaceship; the dot product just gives the
cosine term in the above solution in part (a). The fractional time gain, ah/c2,
is therefore equal to |a|(ˆa · (cid:7))/c2 = a · (cid:7)/c2. Integrating this over the time of
the turnaround, we see that the earth gains a time of

A.1 Taylor series

The general form of a Taylor series is

x2 + f (cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)
3!

(cid:16)(x0)x + f (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0)
2!
which can be verified by taking derivatives and then setting x = 0. For example,
taking the first derivative and then setting x = 0 yields f (cid:16)(x0) on the left, and
also f (cid:16)(x0) on the right, because the first term is a constant and gives zero, the
second term gives f (cid:16)(x0), and all the rest of the terms give zero once we set x = 0
because they all have at least one power of x left in them. Likewise, if we take
the second derivative of each side and then set x = 0, we obtain f (cid:16)(cid:16)(x0) on both
sides. And so on for all derivatives. Therefore, since the two functions on each
side of the above equation are equal at x = 0 and also have their nth derivatives
equal at x = 0 for all n, they must in fact be the same function (assuming that
they’re nicely behaved functions, which we generally assume in physics).

Some specific Taylor series that come up often are listed below. They are
all derivable via Eq. (A.1), but sometimes there are quicker ways of obtaining
them. For example, Eq. (A.3) is most easily obtained by taking the derivative of
Eq. (A.2), which itself is simply the sum of a geometric series.

Appendix B Multivariable, vector calculus

This appendix gives a brief review of multivariable calculus, also known as
vector calculus. The first three topics below (dot product, cross product, partial
derivatives) are used often in this book, so if you haven’t seen them before, you
should read these parts carefully. But the last three topics (gradient, divergence,
curl) are used only occasionally, so it isn’t crucial that you master these (for this
book, at least). For all of the topics, it’s possible to go much deeper into them,
but I’ll present just the basics here. If you want further material, any book on
multivariable calculus should do the trick.

B.1 Dot product

The dot product, or scalar product, between two vectors is defined to be

a · b ≡ axbx + ayby + azbz.

(B.1)

The dot product takes two vectors and produces a scalar, which is just a number.
You can quickly use Eq. (B.1) to show that the dot product is commutative and
distributive. That is, a · b = b · a, and (a + b) · c = a · c + b · c. Note that the
dot product of a vector with itself is a · a = a2
z , which is just its length
x
squared, |a|2 ≡ a2.

+ a2
y

+ a2

Taking the sum of the products of the corresponding components of two vec-
tors, as we did in Eq. (B.1), might seem like a silly and arbitrary thing to do. Why
don’t we instead look at the sum of the cubes of the products of the corresponding
components? The reason is that the dot product as we’ve defined it has many nice
properties, the most useful of which is that it can be written as

a · b = |a||b| cos θ ≡ ab cos θ,

(B.2)

where θ is the angle between the two vectors. We can demonstrate this as follows.
Consider the dot product of the vector c ≡ a + b with itself, which is simply the

679

680

Appendix B

c

a

b

θγ

square of the length of c. Using the commutative and distributive properties, we
have

c2 = (a + b) · (a + b) = a · a + 2a · b + b · b

= a2 + 2a · b + b2.

(B.3)

Fig. B.1

But from the law of cosines applied to the triangle in Fig. B.1, we have

c2 = a2 + b2 − 2ab cos γ = a2 + b2 + 2ab cos θ,

(B.4)

because γ = π − θ. Comparing this with Eq. (B.3) yields a · b = ab cos θ, as
desired. The angle between two vectors is therefore given by

cos θ = a · b
|a||b| .

(B.5)

A nice corollary of this result is that if the dot product of two vectors is zero, then
cos θ = 0, which means that the vectors are perpendicular. If someone gives
you the vectors (1, −2, 3) and (4, 5, 2), it’s by no means obvious that they’re
perpendicular. But you know from Eq. (B.5) that they indeed are.

Geometrically, the dot product a · b = ab cos θ equals the length of a times
the component of b along a. Or vice versa, depending on which length you want
to group the cos θ factor with. If we rotate our coordinate system, the dot product
of two vectors remains the same, because it depends only on their lengths and the
angle between them, and these are unaffected by the rotation. In other words, the
dot product is a scalar. This certainly isn’t obvious from looking at the original
definition in Eq. (B.1), because the coordinates get all messed up during the
rotation.

Example (Distance on the earth): Given the longitude angle φ and the polar
angle θ (measured down from the north pole, so θ is 90
minus the latitude angle)
for two points on the earth, what is the distance between them, as measured along the
earth?
Solution: Our goal is to find the angle, β, between the radii vectors to the two
points, because the desired distance is then Rβ. This would be a tricky problem if
we didn’t have the dot product at our disposal, but things are easy if we make use of
Eq. (B.5) to say that cos β = r1 · r2/R2. The problem then reduces to finding r1 · r2.
The Cartesian components of these vectors are

r1 = R(sin θ1 cos φ1, sin θ1 sin φ1, cos θ1),
r2 = R(sin θ2 cos φ2, sin θ2 sin φ2, cos θ2).
−1(r1 · r2/R2), where

The desired distance is then Rβ = R cos

(B.6)

r1 · r2/R2 = sin θ1 sin θ2(cos φ1 cos φ2 + sin φ1 sin φ2) + cos θ1 cos θ2

= sin θ1 sin θ2 cos(φ2 − φ1) + cos θ1 cos θ2.

(B.7)

Multivariable, vector calculus

681

We can check some limits: If φ1 = φ2, then this gives β = θ2 − θ1 (or θ1 − θ2,
◦
depending on which is larger), as expected. And if θ1 = θ2 = 90
, then it gives
β = φ2 − φ1 (or φ1 − φ2), as expected.

B.2 Cross product

The cross product, or vector product, between two vectors is defined via a
determinant to be
(cid:16)
(cid:16)
(cid:16)
(cid:16)
(cid:16)
(cid:16)

a × b ≡

(cid:16)

ˆx
ax
bx

ˆy
ay
by

ˆz
az
bz

= ˆx(aybz − azby) + ˆy(azbx − axbz) + ˆz(axby − aybx).

(B.8)

The cross product takes two vectors and produces another vector. As with the
dot product, you can show that the cross product is distributive. However, it is
anti-commutative (that is, a × b = −b × a), which is evident from Eq. (B.8). So
the cross product of any vector with itself is zero.

As with the dot product, the reason why we study this particular combination
of components is that it has many nice properties, the most useful of which are
that its direction is perpendicular to both a and b (in the orientation determined
by the right-hand rule; see below), and its magnitude is

|a × b| = |a||b| sin θ ≡ ab sin θ.

(B.9)

Let’s first show that a × b is indeed perpendicular to both a and b. We’ll do this
by making use of the above handy fact that if the dot product of two vectors is
zero, then the vectors are perpendicular. We have

a · (a × b) = ax(aybz − azby) + ay(azbx − axbz) + az(axby − aybx) = 0,

(B.10)

as desired. Likewise for b. There is still an ambiguity, however, because although
we know that a × b points along the direction perpendicular to the plane spanned
by a and b, there are two possible directions along this line. Assuming that our
coordinate system has been chosen to be “right-handed” (that is, if you point the
fingers of your right hand in the direction of ˆx and then swing them to ˆy, your
thumb points along ˆz), then the direction of a × b is determined by the right-
hand rule. That is, if you point the fingers of your right hand in the direction
of a and then swing them to b (through the angle that is less than 180◦), your
thumb points along a × b. This is consistent with the fact that Eq. (B.8) gives
(1, 0, 0) × (0, 1, 0) = (0, 0, 1), or ˆx × ˆy = ˆz.

682

Appendix B

Let’s now demonstrate the |a × b| = ab sin θ result, which is equivalent to
|a × b|2 = a2b2(1 − cos2θ), which is equivalent to |a × b|2 = a2b2 − (a · b)2.
Written in terms of the components, this last equation is

(aybz − azby)2 + (azbx − axbz)2 + (axby − aybx)2
+ b2
y

= (a2
x

+ b2
z

+ a2

+ a2

)(b2
x

) − (axbx + ayby + azbz)2.

(B.11)

If you stare at this long enough, you’ll see that it’s true. The three different
types of terms agree on both sides. For example, both sides have an a2
z term, a
−2aybyazbz term, and no a2

yb2

xb2

x term.

B.3 Partial derivatives

When dealing with a function of only one variable, there is no ambiguity when
taking a derivative. However, with a function of many variables, we have to
specify which one of the variables we’re differentiating with respect to. If we
have a function of, say, two variables, f (x, y), and if we want to take the derivative
with respect to x, then we use the terminology “partial derivative with respect
to x,” with the notation ∂f /∂x. To evaluate this partial derivative, we don’t have
to do anything fancy. We just take a regular derivative with respect to x, while
assuming that y is constant. For example, if f (x, y) = x − 2y + x2y3, then
∂f /∂x = 1 + 2xy3, and ∂f /∂y = −2 + 3x2y2. If we plot the value of f as the
height above the x-y plane, then when we take the partial derivative with respect
to x, we’re simply finding the slope of the curve formed by the intersection of
the function’s surface with the vertical plane parallel to the x axis and passing
through the point in question. Similarly for y.

If we want to maximize or minimize a function of more than one variable,
we need to set all the partial derivatives equal to zero. This is true because if the
partial derivative with respect to a certain variable isn’t zero, then the slope of
the function in that direction is nonzero, which means that the point can’t be a
local maximum or minimum. This argument is the same as in the single-variable
case. It’s just that now we can make the argument for each of the variables
independently.

Demanding that all the partial derivatives equal zero doesn’t actually guarantee
having a local maximum or minimum. The point in question might be a saddle
point, which means that the function is a local maximum in some directions
and a local minimum in others (so in two dimensions the function looks like a
saddle; hence the name). For example, consider the function of two variables,
f (x, y) = 3x2 − y2. Then the point (0, 0) is a local minimum in the x direction
and a local maximum in the y direction.

For two variables, if the second partial derivatives have opposite signs at a
point where the first partial derivatives are zero, then we have a saddle point,
because there is an upward parabola in one direction and a downward parabola

Multivariable, vector calculus

683

in the other. However, we might have a saddle point even if the second partial
derivatives have the same sign. For example, if we make the change of variables
x ≡ w − z and y ≡ w + z in f (x, y) = 3x2 − y2, then it becomes f (w, z) =
2w2 + 2z2 − 8wz. If we didn’t already know from the f (x, y) form that (0, 0)
is a saddle point, we could deduce this in the following way. Imagine that z is
given, and then solve for the w that makes f (w, z) = 0. The result of solving
this quadratic equation is that w takes the form of some multiple of z. That is,
√
w = Az, where A happens to be 2 ±
3 in the present case. Since there are
two (real) solutions for A here, there are two lines, namely w = (2 ±
3)z,
emanating from (0, 0) for which f (w, z) = 0. So (0, 0) can’t be a local maximum
or minimum. It must therefore be a saddle point.1

√

In general, there are two real solutions for A if and only if the discriminant
of the above quadratic equation is positive. For an arbitrary function of two
variables, its shape in the vicinity of a point (which we will take to be (0, 0)
after a shift in the coordinates) where both first partial derivatives are zero can
be approximated by the Taylor series to second order (which you can verify by
taking various derivatives, just as you would do with a function of one variable),

f (x, y) = C + 1

(B.13)

If this is true, then the point is a saddle point. If the left side is less than zero, then
the point is a local maximum or minimum, because there are no nearby points
for which f (x, y) = C; they are all either greater than C or less than C. If the left
side equals zero, then the function looks like a trough, at least in the vicinity of
the point in question (assuming that there is at least some quadratic dependence
in the function).

1 This is true because along these two lines, the first partial derivatives aren’t zero, which means that
the plane of the function’s surface is tilted there. So the function is positive on one side of each
line and negative on the other, which is exactly what happens with a saddle. There is, however,
the special case where the discriminant of the quadratic equation is zero (as with, for example,
f (x, y) = (x − y)2), in which case there is only one solution for A and thus only one line for
which the function is zero. In this case, the function looks like a (possibly upside down) trough.
It is zero (or some given constant) along the line, at least to second order. And it curves up (or
down) quadratically as you move away from the line (assuming that there is at least some quadratic
dependence in the function).

684

Appendix B

B.4 Gradient
Given a function f (x, y, z) (we’ll work mainly with three variables from now on),
we can form the vector whose components are the partial derivatives of f , namely
(∂f /∂x, ∂f /∂y, ∂f /∂z). This vector is called the gradient. If we define the dif-
ferential vector operator ∇ (usually called “del”) to be ∇ ≡ (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z),
then the gradient is simply

∇f =

(cid:2)

∂f
∂x

,

∂f
∂y

,

∂f
∂z

(cid:3)

.

(B.14)

The gradient takes a function and produces a vector. For example, if f (x, y, z) =
xy2 − yz3, then ∇f = (y2, 2xy − z3, −3yz2). We call ∇ an “operator” because it
needs to operate on a function to produce the gradient vector.

What is the physical meaning of the gradient? The gradient gives the direction
you should march in if you want f to increase at the greatest rate. The reason for
this is the following. Consider the value of a function f (x, y, z) at a certain point,
and then look at the value at a nearby point, displaced by the vector (dx, dy, dz).
What (approximately, to first order) is the change in f between the two points?
Well, as you march a distance dx in the x direction, the (first-order) change in f is
(∂f /∂x) dx, by the definition of the partial derivative (just as in the one-variable
case). If you then march a distance dy in the y direction, the function changes by
an additional amount of (∂f /∂y) dy. And likewise the z direction gives a change
of (∂f /∂z) dz. Adding up these three changes in f , we see that the total first-order
change in f is2

df =

∂f
∂x

dx +

∂f

Using the dot product, this can be written concisely as

∂f

· (dx, dy, dz) ≡ ∇f · dr.

(B.16)

is df =
We can now make use of Eq. (B.2) to say that the change in f
|∇f ||dr| cos θ, where θ is the angle between ∇f and dr. The meaning of this
is the following. Consider a given point (x, y, z). The ∇f gradient vector at this
point is a particular vector. Imagine marching along little dr vectors in various
directions and seeing how much f changes (assume that all the dr vectors have
the same length, to be consistent). What direction should you march in, in order
to have f change the most? Or not change at all? In the df = |∇f ||dr| cos θ

2 There is technically an ambiguity in where each of these partial derivative is evaluated, because the
three little steps you took started at three different points. But these ambiguities involve first-order
corrections to the partial derivatives, and since these partial derivatives are already being multiplied
by the first-order dx, dy, and dz terms in Eq. (B.15), any ambiguities will result in second-order
effects and can therefore be ignored.

Multivariable, vector calculus

685

expression, |∇f | has a definite value at the point in question, and we’re assuming
that we pick |dr| to always be the same, so it comes down to the cos θ factor.
Therefore, if you march directly along the ∇f gradient vector at the point, then
f increases the most. And if you march in any direction in the plane perpendic-
ular to ∇f , then f doesn’t change at all (to first order). And if you march in the
direction anti-parallel to ∇f , then f decreases the most.

This is more easily visualized in the case of a function of only two variables,
f (x, y), because then we can picture the value of f as being the height in the
is just a surface of mountains and valleys above
z direction. The graph of f
(or below) the x-y plane. The gradient ∇f = (∂f /∂x, ∂f /∂y) then gives the
direction of steepest ascent. That is, f changes at the greatest rate if you march in
the direction of ∇f in the x-y plane; the slope of the surface in this direction in the
x-y plane is larger than in any other direction. And if you march in either direction
along the line in the x-y plane that is perpendicular to ∇f , then f has zero change.
By continuing to march along the direction perpendicular to ∇f wherever you
are, you will form a curve in the x-y plane for which all the points give the same
value of f . In other words, if you slice the surface of f with a horizontal plane
whose height equals this particular value of f , and if you look at the intersection
of this plane with the surface, then the projection of this intersection onto the x-y
plane is the above curve you formed in the x-y plane.

B.5 Divergence

Consider a vector whose components are functions of the coordinates. For exam-
ple, let F = (Fx, Fy, Fz) = (3xz, 2y2 + xyz, x2 + z3). Then the divergence of F
is defined to be the dot product of the ∇ operator with F, that is,

∇ · F =

∂Fx
∂x

+

∂Fy
∂y

+

∂Fz
∂z

.

(B.17)

The divergence takes a vector and produces a number. The above F has a
divergence of (3z) + (4y + xz) + (3z2).

What is the physical meaning of the divergence? Consider an infinitesimal
box with sides of length dx, dy, and dz. Then the divergence measures the net
flux of the vector field out of the box, divided by the volume of the box. (The flux
through a surface is defined to be the integral of the area times the component
of the vector perpendicular to the surface.) For example, if a certain vector field
gives the velocity at each point in a fluid flow, and if the divergence is nonzero,
then there must be a source (or sink) that creates (or destroys) fluid, because
otherwise whatever fluid goes into the little box would have to come out of it
somewhere, yielding zero net flux.

Let’s see why the divergence equals the flux per volume. Consider the “left”
dy × dz face of the little box. The amount of flux from the vector field into the
box through this face equals the area dy dz times the Fx component. (The Fy and

686

Appendix B

Fz components are parallel to this face and therefore contribute nothing to the
flux through it.) The amount of flux out of the “right” dy × dz face equals the area
dy dz times the value of the Fx component there. But this value equals (to first
order) the original Fx plus (∂Fx/∂x) dx, by the definition of the partial derivative.
The Fx part of this cancels the inward flux from the left face, so the net flux out of
(cid:5)
the little box through these two faces is
dy dz. Similar calculations
work for the other two pairs of parallel faces, so the total flux out of the box is

(∂Fx/∂x) dx

(cid:6)

Net flux =

(cid:2)

∂Fx
∂x

+

∂Fy
∂y

+

∂Fz

(cid:3)

dx dy dz.

(B.18)

Therefore, as promised, the net flux per volume equals the divergence. The
integrated form of this result is the divergence theorem, or Gauss’theorem, which
takes the form,

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

∇ · F dV =

F · dA.

V

S

(B.19)

The integral on the left runs over a given volume, and the integral on the right runs
over the surface that encloses this volume. The vector dA has a magnitude equal
to an infinitesimal piece of area of S and a direction defined to be perpendicular
to the plane containing this piece (with the positive direction being outward from
the volume). Dotting dA with F has the effect of picking out only the component
of F that is perpendicular to the piece (which is what is relevant in calculating
the flux).

We’ll skip the fine details here, but the basic idea of the proof of Eq. (B.19)
is to divide the volume up into many infinitesimal cubes and to look at the total
flux through all the cubes. From Eq. (B.18), the integral of the divergence over
one little cube (which is essentially the divergence times the volume, because the
divergence is essentially constant over the tiny volume) equals the flux through
that cube. The integral of the divergence over the whole volume therefore equals
the sum of the fluxes through all the cubes. But all the faces of the cubes that
lie in the interior of the volume are shared by two cubes, so the flux through
these faces cancels when taking the sum (because the flux through a given face
is counted positive for one cube and negative for the other). So we are left with
only the flux through the faces on the boundary of the volume (because these
faces appear only once in the total integral). We are therefore left with the flux
through the surface S, which is what appears on the right-hand side of Eq. (B.19).

Example (Flux through a sphere): Verify the divergence theorem in the case
where the surface is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin, and F = (x, y, z).

Solution: On the left-hand side of Eq. (B.19), the divergence of (x, y, z) is 1+1+1=3,
so the integral of this over the volume of the sphere is simply 3(4πR3/3) = 4πR3.
On the right-hand side, the unit vector perpendicular to the surface is (x, y, z)/R, so

Multivariable, vector calculus

687

dA = (dA)(x, y, z)/R. The dot product of this with (x, y, z) is (dA)(x2 + y2 + z2)/
R = (dA)R. The integral of this over the surface of the sphere is just (4πR2)R = 4πR3.
The two sides are therefore equal, as we wanted to show.

B.6 Curl

Consider a vector whose components are functions of the coordinates. For exam-
ple, let F = (Fx, Fy, Fz) = (3xz, x2yz, x + z). Then the curl of F is defined to be
the cross product of the ∇ operator with F, that is,

∇ × F ≡

(X+dX, Y+dY)

The curl takes a vector and produces another vector. The above F has a curl of
(−x2y, 3x − 1, 2xyz).

What is the physical meaning of the curl? Consider the infinitesimal rectangle
shown in Fig. B.2. This rectangle lies in the x-y plane, so for the moment we will
suppress the z component of all coordinates, for convenience. It turns out that
F · dr around
the z component of the curl equals the counterclockwise integral
the closed loop, divided by the area of the loop (similar statements hold for the y
and x components and the associated little rectangles in the x-z and y-z planes).
Let’s see why this is true.

(cid:17)

The total counterclockwise integral of F · dr around the loop entails moving
to the right on segment 1 and to the left on 3, and up on segment 2 and down on
4. On segments 1 and 3, both dy and dz are zero, so only the Fx dx term survives
in the dot product F · dr. Likewise, Fy dy is the only nonzero term on segments
2 and 4. If we pair up the two pairs of parallel sides, the total counterclockwise
integral is

The first approximation here is valid due to the definition of the partial derivative.
The second approximation (replacing x with X ) is valid because our rectangle is
small enough so that x is essentially equal to X . Any error in this approximation
is second-order small, because we already have a factor of dY in our term. A
similar treatment works for the Fy terms, so Eq. (B.21) becomes

As promised, the z component of the curl equals the counterclockwise integral
(cid:17)
F · dr around the closed loop, divided by the area of the loop. The preceding
analysis also works, of course, for little rectangles in the x-z and y-z planes. We
therefore obtain the two other components of the curl.

The generalization of the above result to tilted and wavy surfaces is Stokes’

theorem, which states that
(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(∇ × F) · dA =

F · dr.

S

C

(B.25)

The integral on the left runs over a given surface, and the integral on the right
runs over the curve that is the boundary of this surface. The vector dA has a
magnitude equal to an infinitesimal piece of area of S and a direction defined to
be perpendicular to the plane containing this piece (with its orientation defined
via the orientation along C and the right-hand rule). We’ll skip the details here,
but the basic idea of the proof is similar to the idea behind the divergence theorem
above, except with certain words replaced by other words (“volume” becomes
“surface,” and “surface” becomes “curve,” etc.). We’ll divide the surface up
into many infinitesimal rectangles and look at the total integral around all the
rectangles. For simplicity, let’s just deal with a flat surface in the x-y plane.

From above, the integral of the z component of the curl over one little rectangle
equals the counterclockwise integral of F · dr around the edges of the rectangle.
The integral of the z component of the curl over the whole surface therefore
equals the sum of the integrals around all the rectangles. But all the edges of the
rectangles that lie in the interior of the surface are shared by two rectangles, so
the integral along these edges cancels when taking the sum (because the integral
along a given edge is counted positive for one rectangle and negative for the
other). So we are left with only the integral along the edges on the boundary of
the surface (because these edges appear only once in the total integral). We are
therefore left with the integral along the curve C, which is what appears on the
right-hand side of Eq. (B.25).

Multivariable, vector calculus

Note that if the surface is closed, so that it has no boundary (in other words,
there is no curve C), then the right-hand side of Eq. (B.25) is zero, and hence
the left-hand side is also. Such is the case with, for example, a sphere. Having
no boundary means that if you’re a little bug walking on the surface, you can’t
walk off it.

Example (Integral around a circle): Verify Stokes’ theorem in the case where
the curve is a circle of radius R in the x-y plane, centered at the origin, and
F = (−y, x, 0).

Solution: On the left-hand side of Eq. (B.25), the curl of (−y, x, 0) is (0, 0, 2). The
dA vector also points in the z direction, so the dot product is just 2(dA). The integral
of this over the interior of the circle is simply 2(πR2). On the right-hand side, the dot
product equals −y dx + x dy. Integrating this along the circumference of the circle is
most easily done in polar coordinates. With x = R cos θ and y = R sin θ, we have
dx = −R sin θ dθ and dy = R cos θ dθ . So −y dx + x dy = R2 dθ. The integral of
this as θ ranges from 0 to 2π is R2(2π). The two sides are therefore equal, as desired.

There are some handy facts that deal with combinations of the gradient, diver-
gence, and curl. One is that the curl of a gradient is identically zero. That is,
∇ × ∇f = 0. You can verify this explicitly by using the definitions of the curl
and the gradient, and also the fact that partial differentiation is commutative
(that is, ∂ 2f /∂x ∂y = ∂ 2f /∂y ∂x). Alternatively, you can let F ≡ ∇f in Stokes’
∇f · dr. The right-hand side of
theorem, which gives
this is simply the net change in the function f around the closed curve C, which
is always zero. The integrand on the left-hand side must therefore identically
be zero.

Also, the divergence of a curl is identically zero. That is, ∇·(∇×F) = 0. Again,
you can verify this explicitly by using the definitions of the divergence and the
curl, and also the fact that partial differentiation is commutative. Alternatively,
∇ · (∇ ×
you can combine Gauss’ theorem and Stokes’ theorem to write

C F · dr. The right-hand side is always zero, because the boundary
surface S of any given volume V is closed, so there is no curve C. The integrand

Appendix C F = ma vs. F = dp/dt

In nonrelativistic mechanics,1 the equations F = ma and F = dp/dt say exactly
the same thing if m is constant. But if m is not constant, then dp/dt = d(mv)/dt =
ma + (dm/dt)v, which doesn’t equal ma. So if a system has a changing mass,
should we use F = ma or F = dp/dt? Which equation correctly describes the
physics? The answer to this depends on what you label as the system to which
you associate the quantities m, p, and a. You can generally do a problem using
either F = ma or F = dp/dt, but you must be very careful about how you label
things and how you treat them. The subtleties are best understood through two
examples.

Example 1 (Sand dropping into a cart): Consider a cart into which sand is
dropped vertically at a rate dm/dt = σ . With what force must you push on the cart
to keep it moving horizontally at a constant speed v? (This was the setup in the first
example in Section 5.8.)

First solution: Let m(t) be the mass of the cart-plus-sand-inside system (which
we’ll just call the “cart”). If we use F = ma (where a is the acceleration of the cart,
which is zero), then we obtain F = 0, which is incorrect. The correct expression to
use is F = dp/dt. This gives

F = dp
dt

= ma + dm
dt

v = 0 + σ v.

(C.1)

This makes sense, because your force is what increases the momentum of the cart,
and this momentum increases simply because the mass of the cart increases.

It is possible to solve this problem by using F = ma if we let
Second solution:
our system be a small piece of mass that is being added to the cart. Your force is what
accelerates this mass from rest to speed v. Consider a mass (cid:16)m that falls into the cart
during a time (cid:16)t. Imagine that it falls into the cart in one lump at the start of the (cid:16)t,
and then accelerates up to speed v during the time (cid:16)t. (It accelerates due to friction.
But if you want, you can eliminate the cart as the intermediate object and just push
directly on the mass.) This process repeats during each successive (cid:16)t interval. We

1 We won’t bother with relativity in this appendix, because nonrelativistic mechanics contains all

the critical aspects we want to address.

690

F = ma vs. F = dp/dt

691

can use F = ma here because the mass of the small piece is constant. So we have
F = ma = (cid:16)m(v/(cid:16)t). Writing this as ((cid:16)m/(cid:16)t)v gives the σ v result we found above.

Third solution: As in the second solution, let’s imagine the process occurring in
discrete steps, but now with the cart as the system. Assume that a mass (cid:16)m falls into
the cart and instantaneously decreases its speed (by conservation of momentum) to
v(cid:16) = mv/(m+(cid:16)m), which is (cid:16)v = v −v(cid:16) = v(cid:16)m/(m+(cid:16)m) less than the original v.
Assume that you then push on the cart for a time (cid:16)t (during which the mass remains
constant at m + (cid:16)m, so F = ma is the relevant expression) and bring it back up to
speed v. The acceleration is a = (cid:16)v/(cid:16)t = v((cid:16)m/(cid:16)t)/(m + (cid:16)m) = σ v/(m + (cid:16)m),
so your force is

F = (m + (cid:16)m)a = (m + (cid:16)m)

= σ v.

(C.2)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

σ v
m + (cid:16)m

Example 2 (Sand leaking from a cart): Consider a cart that leaks sand out
of the bottom at a rate dm/dt = σ . If you apply a force F to the cart, what is its
acceleration?
Solution: Let m(t) be the mass of the cart-plus-sand-inside system (the “cart”). In
this example, the correct expression to use is F = ma, so the acceleration is

a = F
m

.

(C.3)

Note that since m decreases with time, a increases with time. We used F = ma here
because at any instant, the mass m is what is being accelerated by the force F. As
above, you can imagine the process occurring in discrete steps: You push on the mass
for a short period of time, then a little piece instantaneously leaks out; then you push
again on the new (smaller) mass, then another little piece leaks out; and so on. In this
discretized scenario, it is clear that F = ma is the appropriate formula, because it
holds for each step in the process. The only ambiguity is whether to use m or m + dm
at a certain time, but this yields a negligible error.

It is still true that F = dp/dt in this second example, provided that you let
Remarks:
F be total force, and let p be the total momentum. In this example, F is the only force.
However, the total momentum consists of both the sand in the cart and the sand that has
leaked out and is falling through the air.2 A common mistake is to use F = dp/dt, with p
being only the cart’s momentum. The leaked sand still has momentum.

There is a simple example that demonstrates why F = dp/dt doesn’t work when p
refers only to the cart. Choose F = 0, so that the cart moves with constant speed v. Cut
the cart in half, and label the back part as the “leaked sand” and the front part as the
“cart.” If you want the cart’s p to have dp/dt = F = 0, then the cart’s speed must double
if its mass gets cut in half. But this is nonsense. Both halves simply continue to move
at the same rate. ♣

2 If there were air resistance, we would have to worry about its effect on the falling sand if we wanted
to use F = dp/dt to solve the problem, where p is the total momentum. This is clearly not the best
way to do the problem. If complicated things happen with the sand in the air, it would be foolish
to consider this part of the sand when we don’t have to.

692

Appendix C

To sum up, F = dp/dt is always valid, provided that you use the total force
and total momentum of a given system of particles. This approach, however, can
get messy in certain situations. So in some cases it is easier to use an F = ma
argument, but you must be careful to correctly identify the system that is being
accelerated by the force. The asymmetry in the above two examples is that in
the first example, the force does indeed accelerate the incoming sand. But in the
second example, the force does not accelerate (or decelerate) the outgoing sand.
F has nothing to do with the leaked sand.

Appendix D Existence of principal axes

In this appendix, we will prove Theorem 9.4. That is, we will show that an
orthonormal set of principal axes does indeed exist for any object, and for any
choice of origin. It isn’t crucial that you study this proof. If you want to just
accept the fact that principal axes exist, that’s perfectly fine. But the method we
will use in this proof is one you will see again and again in your physics stud-
ies, in particular when you study quantum mechanics (see the remark following
the proof).

Theorem D.1 Given a real symmetric 3 × 3 matrix, I, there exist three
orthonormal real vectors, ˆωk , and three real numbers, Ik , with the property
that

I ˆωk = Ik ˆωk .

(D.1)

Proof: This theorem holds more generally with 3 replaced by N (all the steps
below easily generalize), but we’ll work with N = 3, to be concrete. Consider a
general 3 × 3 matrix, I (we don’t need to assume yet that it’s real or symmetric).
Assume that Iu = I u for some vector u and some number I . 1 This may be
rewritten as

⎛

In order for there to be a nontrivial solution for the vector u (that is, one where u (cid:13)=
(0, 0, 0)), the determinant of this matrix must be zero.2 Taking the determinant,
we see that we get an equation for I of the form

aI 3 + bI 2 + cI + d = 0.

(D.3)

1 Such a vector u is called an eigenvector of I, and the associated I is called an eigenvalue. But don’t

let these names scare you. They’re just definitions.

2 If the determinant were not zero, then we could explicitly construct the inverse of the matrix, which
involves cofactors divided by the determinant. Multiplying both sides by this inverse would yield
u = 0.

693

694

Appendix D

The constants a, b, c, and d are functions of the matrix entries Iij, but we won’t
need their precise form to prove this existence theorem. The only thing we need
this equation for is to say that there do exist three (generally complex) solutions
for I , because the equation is a cubic.

We will now show that the solutions for I are real. This will imply that there
exist three real vectors u satisfying Iu = I u, because we can plug the real I ’s
back into Eq. (D.2) and solve for the real components ux, uy, and uz, up to an
overall constant. We will then show that these vectors are orthogonal.

• Proof that the I’s are real: This follows from the real and symmetric conditions on I.

Start with the equation Iu = I u, and take the dot product with u

to obtain

The vector u
is the vector obtained by complex conjugating each component of u (we
don’t know yet that u can be chosen to be real). On the right side, I is a scalar, so we can
∗
take it out from between the u
and u. The fact that I is real implies that if we complex
conjugate the equation Iu = I u, we obtain Iu
(we know that I is real, but we
don’t know yet that I is real). If we then take the dot product of this equation with u,
we obtain

∗ = I

∗

∗ = I

(D.5)

We now claim that if I is symmetric, then a · Ib = b · Ia, for any vectors a and b.
(We’ll leave this for you to show by simply multiplying each side out.) In particular,
∗
∗ · Iu = u · Iu
u

, so Eqs. (D.4) and (D.5) give

(I − I

∗)u · u

∗ = 0.

And since u · u
is real.

∗ = |u1|2 + |u2|2 + |u3|2 (cid:13)= 0, we must have I = I

(D.6)

∗

. Therefore, I

• Proof that the u are orthogonal: This follows from the symmetric condition on I. Let
Iu1 = I1u1, and Iu2 = I2u2. Take the dot product of the former equation with u2 to
obtain

u2 · Iu1 = I1u2 · u1,

and take the dot product of the latter equation with u1 to obtain

u1 · Iu2 = I2u1 · u2.

(D.7)

(D.8)

As above, the symmetric condition on I implies that the left-hand sides of Eqs. (D.7)
and (D.8) are equal. Therefore,

(I1 − I2)u1 · u2 = 0.

(D.9)

Existence of principal axes

695

There are two possibilities here: (1) If I1 (cid:13)= I2, then we are done, because u1 · u2 = 0,
which says that u1 and u2 are orthogonal. (2) If I1 = I2 ≡ I , then we have I(au1 +
bu2) = I (au1 + bu2), for any a and b. So any linear combination of u1 and u2 has
the same property that u1 and u2 have (namely, that applying I is the same as just
multiplying by I ). We therefore have a whole plane of such vectors, so we can pick any
two orthogonal vectors in this plane to be called u1 and u2.

This theorem proves the existence of principal axes, because the inertia tensor in
Eq. (9.8) is indeed a real and symmetric matrix.

Remark:
(Warning: This remark has nothing to do with classical mechanics. It’s simply
an ill-disguised excuse to get a limerick on quantum mechanics into the book.) In quantum
mechanics, it turns out that any observable quantity, such as position, energy, momentum,
angular momentum, etc., can be represented by a Hermitian matrix, with the observed value
being an eigenvalue of the matrix. A Hermitian matrix is a (generally complex) matrix with the
property that the transpose of the matrix equals the complex conjugate of itself. For example,
a 2 × 2 Hermitian matrix must be of the form,

(cid:2)

a
b − ic

b + ic
d

(cid:3)

,

(D.10)

for real numbers a, b, c, and d. Now, if observed values are to be given by the eigenvalues of
such a matrix, then the eigenvalues had better be real, because no one (in this world, at least)
is about to go for a jog of 4 + 3i miles, or pay an electric bill for 17 − 43i kilowatt-hours. And
indeed, you can show, via a slightly modified version of the above “Proof that the I ’s are real”
procedure, that the eigenvalues of any Hermitian matrix are in fact real. (And likewise, the
eigenvectors are orthogonal.) This is, to say the least, very fortunate.

God’s first tries were hardly ideal,
For complex worlds have no appeal.
So in the present edition,
He made things Hermitian,
And this world, it seems, is quite real. ♣

Appendix E Diagonalizing matrices

This appendix is relevant to Section 9.3, which covers principal axes. The process
of diagonalizing matrices (that is, finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues,
defined below) has countless applications in a wide variety of subjects. We’ll
describe the process here as it applies to principal axes and moments of inertia.
Let’s find the three principal axes and moments of inertia for a square with
side length a, mass m, and one corner at the origin. The square lies in the x-y
plane, with sides along the x and y axes (see Fig. E.1). We’ll choose the given
x, y, and z axes as our initial basis axes. Using Eq. (9.8), you can show that the
matrix I (with respect to this initial basis) is

where ρ is the mass per unit area, so that a2ρ = m. We have used the fact that
z = 0, and we have not bothered to write the dx dy in the integrals.

Our goal is to find the basis in which I is diagonal. That is, we want to find
three solutions1 for u (and I ) for the equation Iu = I u. Letting I ≡ λma2 to make
things look a little cleaner, and using the above explicit form of I, the equation
(I − I )u = 0 becomes

9.4, we know that the other two vectors must lie in the x-y plane. So we could quickly reduce this
problem to a two-dimensional one, but let’s forge ahead with the general method.

equation for λ is easy to solve, because the determinant is [(1/3 − λ)2 − (1/4)2]
(2/3 − λ) = 0. The solutions are λ = 1/3 ± 1/4, and λ = 2/3. So our three
principal moments, I ≡ λma2, are

These are the eigenvalues of I.

What are the vectors, u1, u2, and u3, associated with each of these I ’s? Plug-
ging λ = 7/12 into Eq. (E.2) gives the three equations (one for each component),
−ux − uy = 0, −ux − uy = 0, and uz = 0. These are redundant equations (that
was the point of setting the determinant equal to zero). So ux = −uy, and uz = 0.
The vector may therefore be written as u1 = (c, −c, 0), where c is any con-
stant.2 If we want a normalized vector, then c = 1/
2. In a similar manner,
plugging λ = 1/12 into Eq. (E.2) gives u2 = (c, c, 0). And finally, plugging
λ = 2/3 into Eq. (E.2) gives u3 = (0, 0, c), as claimed in the above footnote.
Our three orthonormal principal axes corresponding to the moments in Eq. (E.3)
are therefore

In other words, we have “diagonalized” the matrix. The basic idea is that from
now on we should use the principal axes as our basis vectors. We can forget that
we ever had anything to do with the original x, y, and z axes.

Remarks:

1. I1 + I2 = I3, as the perpendicular-axis theorem demands.
2. I2 is the moment around one diagonal through the center of the square, which of course
equals the moment around the other diagonal through the center. But the latter is related
to I1 by the parallel-axis theorem. And indeed, I1 = I2 + m(a/

2 )2.

√

3. Any axis through the center of the square, in the plane of the square, has the same moment
(by Theorem 9.5 or 9.6). So I2 equals the moment around an axis through the center,
parallel to a side. But this is the same as the moment of a stick of length a around its
center (the extent of the square in the direction of the axis is irrelevant). Hence the factor
of 1/12 in I2. ♣

2 We can solve for u only up to an overall constant, because if Iu = I u is true for a certain u, then

it is also true that I(cu) = I (cu), where c is any constant.

Appendix F Qualitative relativity questions

1. Is there such a thing as a perfectly rigid object?

Answer: No. Since information can move no faster than the speed of
light, it takes time for the atoms in the object to communicate with each
other. If you push on one end of a rod, then the other end won’t move right
away. If it did move right away, then these “pushing” and “moving” events
would be spacelike separated (see Section 11.6), which would mean that
there would exist a frame in which the “moving” event occurred before
the “pushing” event. This is a violation of causality, so we conclude that
the other end doesn’t move right away.

2. How do you synchronize two clocks that are at rest with respect to each

other?

Answer: One way is to put a light source midway between the two
clocks and send out signals, and then set the clocks to a certain value
when the signals hit them. Another way is to put a watch right next to
one of the clocks and synchronize it with this clock, and then move the
watch very slowly over to the other clock and synchronize that clock with
it. Any time-dilation effects can be made arbitrarily small by moving
the watch sufficiently slowly, because the time-dilation effect is second
order in v.

3. Moving clocks run slow. Does this result have anything to do with the time

it takes light to travel from the clock to your eye?

Answer: No. When we talk about how fast a clock is running in a given
frame, we are referring to what the clock actually reads in that frame. It
will certainly take time for the light from the clock to reach an observer’s
eye, but it is understood that the observer subtracts off this transit time in
order to calculate the time at which the clock actually shows a particular
reading. Likewise, other relativistic effects, such as length contraction and
the loss of simultaneity, have nothing to do with the time it takes light to
reach your eye. They deal only with what really is, in your frame. One way
to avoid the complication of the travel time of light is to use the lattice of
clocks and meter sticks described at the end of Section 11.3.3.

698

Qualitative relativity questions

699

4. Does time dilation depend on whether a clock is moving across your vision

or directly away from you?

Answer: No. A moving clock runs slow, no matter which way it is mov-
ing. This is clearer if you think in terms of the lattice of clocks and meter
sticks from Section 11.3.3. If you imagine a million people standing at the
points of the lattice, then they all observe the clock running slow. Time
dilation is an effect that depends on the frame and the speed of a clock
with respect to it. It doesn’t matter where you are in the frame (as long as
you’re at rest in it).

5. Does special-relativistic time dilation depend on the acceleration of the

moving clock?

(cid:4)

Answer: No. The time-dilation factor is γ = 1/
1 − v2/c2, which
doesn’t depend on a. The only relevant quantity is the v at a given instant.
It doesn’t matter if v is changing. But if you are accelerating, then you can’t
naively apply the results of Special Relativity. (To do things correctly, it is
perhaps easiest to think in terms of General Relativity. But GR is actually
not required; see Chapter 14 for a discussion of this.) But as long as you
represent an inertial frame, then the clock you are viewing can undergo
whatever motion it wants, and you will observe it running slow by the
simple factor of γ .

6. Someone says, “A stick that is length-contracted isn’t really shorter, it just

looks shorter.” How do you respond?

Answer: The stick really is shorter in your frame. Length contraction
has nothing to do with how things look. It has to do with where the ends of
the stick are at simultaneous times in your frame. (This is, after all, how
you measure the length of something.) At a given instant in time in your
frame, the distance between the ends of the stick is indeed less than the
proper length of the stick.

7. Consider a stick that moves in the direction in which it points. Does its length
contraction depend on whether this direction is across your vision or directly
away from you?

Answer: No. The stick is length-contracted in both cases. Of course, if
you look at the stick in the latter case, then all you see is the end, which
is just a dot. But the stick is indeed shorter in your reference frame. As in
Question 4 above, length contraction depends on the frame, not where you
are in it.

8. A mirror moves toward you at speed v. You shine a light toward it and the
light beam bounces back at you. What is the speed of the reflected beam?

Answer: The speed is c, as always. You will observe the light having a
higher frequency, due to the Doppler effect. But the speed is still c.

700

Appendix F

9. In relativity, the order of two events in one frame may be reversed in another
frame. Does this imply that there exists a frame in which I get off a bus before I
get on it?

Answer: No. The order of two events can be reversed in another frame
only if the events are spacelike separated. That is, if (cid:16)x > c(cid:16)t (in other
words, the events are too far apart for even light to get from one to the
other). The two relevant events here (getting on the bus, and getting off
the bus) are not spacelike separated, because the bus travels at a speed less
than c, of course. They are timelike separated. Therefore, in all frames it
is the case that I get off the bus after I get on it.

There would be causality problems if there existed a frame in which I
got off the bus before I got on it. If I break my ankle getting off a bus, then
I wouldn’t be able to make the mad dash that I made to catch the bus in
the first place, in which case I wouldn’t have the opportunity to break my
ankle getting off the bus, in which case I could have made the mad dash
to catch the bus and get on, and, well, you get the idea.

10. You are in a spaceship sailing along in outer space. Is there any way you can

measure your speed without looking outside?

Answer: There are two points to be made here. First, the question is
meaningless, because absolute speed doesn’t exist. The spaceship doesn’t
have a speed; it only has a speed relative to something else. Second, even
if the question asked for the speed with respect to, say, a given piece of
stellar dust, the answer would be “no.” Uniform speed is not measurable
from within the spaceship. Acceleration, on the other hand, is measurable
(assuming there is no gravity around to confuse it with).

11. If you move at the speed of light, what shape does the universe take in your

frame?

Answer: The question is meaningless, because it’s impossible for you
to move at the speed of light. A meaningful question to ask is: What shape
does the universe take if you move at a speed very close to c? The answer
is that in your frame everything would be squashed along the direction of
your motion, due to length contraction. Any given region of the universe
would be squashed down to a pancake.

12. Two objects fly toward you, one from the east with speed u, and the other
from the west with speed v. Is it correct that their relative speed, as measured
by you, is u + v? Or should you use the velocity-addition formula, V =
(u + v)/(1 + uv/c2)? Is it possible for their relative speed, as measured by
you, to exceed c?

Answer: Yes, no, yes, to the three questions. It is legal to simply add the
two speeds to obtain u + v. There is no need to use the velocity-addition
formula, because both speeds here are measured with respect to the same

Qualitative relativity questions

701

thing, namely you. It’s perfectly legal for the result to be greater than c,
but it must be less than (or equal to, for photons) 2c.

You need to use the velocity-addition formula when, for example, you
are given the speed of a ball with respect to a train, and also the speed of
the train with respect to the ground, and your goal is to find the speed of
the ball with respect to the ground. The point is that now the two given
speeds are measured with respect to different things, namely the train and
the ground.

13. Two clocks at the ends of a train are synchronized with respect to the train.

If the train moves past you, which clock shows the higher time?

Answer: The rear clock shows the higher time. It shows Lv/c2 more
than the front clock, where L is the proper length of the train.

14. A train moves at speed 4c/5. A clock is thrown from the back of the
train to the front. As measured in the ground frame, the time of flight is
1 second. Is the following reasoning correct? “The γ factor between the
train and the ground is γ = 1/
1 − (4/5)2 = 5/3. And since moving
clocks run slow, the time elapsed on the clock during the flight is 3/5 of a
second.”

(cid:4)

Answer: No. It is incorrect, because the time-dilation result holds only
for two events that happen at the same place in the relevant reference frame
(the train, here). The clock moves with respect to the train, so the above
reasoning is invalid.

Another way of seeing why it must be incorrect is the following. A
certainly valid way to calculate the clock’s elapsed time is to find the
speed of the clock with respect to the ground (more information would
have to be given to determine this), and to then apply time dilation with
the associated γ factor to arrive at the answer of (1 s)/γ . Since the clock’s
v is definitely not 4c/5, the correct answer is definitely not 3/5 s.

15. Person A chases person B. As measured in the ground frame, they have speeds
4c/5 and 3c/5, respectively. If they start a distance L apart (as measured in
the ground frame), how much time will it take (as measured in the ground
frame) for A to catch B?

Answer: As measured in the ground frame, the relative speed is 4c/5 −
3c/5 = c/5. Person A must close the initial gap of L, so the time it takes
is L/(c/5) = 5L/c. There is no need to use any fancy velocity-addition
or length-contraction formulas, because all quantities in this problem are
measured with respect to the same frame. So it quickly reduces to a simple
“(rate)(time) = (distance)” problem.

16. Is the “the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames” postulate really
necessary? That is, is it not already implied by the “the laws of physics are
the same in all inertial frames” postulate?

702

Appendix F

Answer: Yes, it is necessary. The speed-of-light postulate is definitely
not implied by the laws-of-physics postulate. The latter doesn’t imply that
baseballs have the same speed in all inertial frames, so it likewise doesn’t
imply it for light.

It turns out that nearly all the results in Special Relativity can be deduced
by using only the laws-of-physics postulate. What you can find (with
some work) is that there is some limiting speed, which may or may not be
infinite (see Section 11.10). But you still have to say whether this speed is
finite or infinite. The speed-of-light postulate does the trick.

17. Imagine closing a very large pair of scissors. It is quite possible for the point
of intersection of the blades to move faster than the speed of light. Does this
violate anything in relativity?

Answer: No. If the angle between the blades is small enough, then the
tips of the blades (and all the other atoms in the scissors) can move at a
speed well below c, while the intersection point moves faster than c. But
this doesn’t violate anything in relativity. The intersection point is not an
actual object, so there is nothing wrong with it moving faster than c.

You might be worried that this result allows you to send a signal down
the scissors at a speed faster than c. However, since there is no such thing
as a rigid body, it is impossible to get the far end of the scissors to move
right away, when you apply a force at the handle. The scissors would have
to already be moving, in which case the motion is independent of any
decision you make at the handle to change the motion of the blades.

18. Two twins travel away from each other at relativistic speed. The time-dilation
result says that each twin sees the other twin’s clock running slow, so each
says the other has aged less. How would you reply to someone who asks,
“But which twin really is younger?”

It makes no sense to ask which twin really is younger, because
Answer:
the two twins aren’t in the same reference frame; they are using different
coordinates to measure time. It’s as silly as having two people run away
from each other into the distance (so that each person sees the other become
small), and then asking: Who is really smaller?

19. A particular event has coordinates (x, t) in one frame. How do you use a
Lorentz transformation to find the coordinates of this event in another frame?

Answer: You don’t. Lorentz transformations have nothing to do with
single events. They deal only with pairs of events and the separation
between them. As far as a single event goes, its coordinates in another
frame can be anything you want, simply by defining your origin to be
wherever and whenever you please. But for pairs of events, their separation

Qualitative relativity questions

703

is a well-defined quantity, independent of any definition of origin. It is
therefore a meaningful question to ask how the separations in two different
frames are related, and the Lorentz transformations answer this question.

20. When using the Lorentz transformations, how do you tell which frame is the

moving “primed” frame?

Answer: You don’t. There is no preferred frame, so it doesn’t make
sense to ask which frame is moving. We used the “primed” notation in
the derivation in Section 11.4.1 for ease of notation, but don’t take it to
imply that there is a preferred frame S and a less fundamental frame S(cid:16). In
general, a better notation is to use subscripts that describe the two frames,
such as “g” for ground and “t” for train. For example, if you know the
values of (cid:16)tt and (cid:16)xt on a train (which we’ll assume is moving in the
positive x direction with respect to the ground), and if you want to find
the values of (cid:16)tg and (cid:16)xg on the ground, then you can write down:

(cid:16)xg = γ ((cid:16)xt + v (cid:16)tt),
(cid:16)tg = γ ((cid:16)tt + v (cid:16)xt/c2).

(F.1)

The sign is a “+” because the frame associated with the left side of the
equation (the ground) sees the frame associated with the right side (the
train) moving to the right. If instead you know the intervals on the ground
and you want to find them on the train, then you just need to switch the
subscripts “g” and “t” and change the sign to “−”, by the reasoning in the
previous sentence.

21. The momentum of an object with mass m and speed v is p = γ mv. “A photon
has zero mass, so it should have zero momentum.” Correct or incorrect?

Incorrect. True, m is zero, but the γ factor is infinite because
Answer:
v = c. Infinity times zero is undefined. A photon does indeed have momen-
tum, and it equals E/c (which happens to equal hν/c, where ν is the
frequency of the light).

22. It is not necessary to postulate the impossibility of accelerating an object
to speed c. It follows as a consequence of the relativistic form of energy.
Explain.

Answer: E = γ mc2, so if v = c then γ = ∞, and the object must have
an infinite amount of energy (unless m = 0, as for a photon). All the energy
in the universe, let alone all the king’s horses and all the king’s men, can’t
accelerate something to speed c.

Appendix G Derivations of the Lv/c 2 result

In Section 11.3.1, we showed that if a train with proper length L moves at speed
v with respect to the ground, then in the ground frame the rear clock reads Lv/c2
more than the front clock (assuming that the clocks are synchronized in the train
frame). There are various other ways to derive this result, so for the fun of it
I’ve listed here all the derivations I can think of. The explanations are terse, but I
refer you to the specific problem or section in the text where things are discussed
in more detail. Many of these derivations are slight variations on each other, so
perhaps they shouldn’t all count as separate ones, but here’s my list:

1. Light source on train: Put a light source on a train, at distances df = L(c − v)/2c
from the front and db = L(c + v)/2c from the back. You can show that the photons
hit the ends of the train simultaneously in the ground frame. But they hit the ends
at different times in the train frame; the difference in the readings on clocks at the
ends when the photons run into them is (db − df )/c = Lv/c2. Therefore, at a given
instant in the ground frame (for example, the moment when the clocks at the ends are
simultaneously illuminated by the photons), a person on the ground sees the rear clock
read Lv/c2 more than the front clock. (See the example in Section 11.3.1.)

2. Lorentz transformation: The second of Eqs. (11.17) is (cid:16)tg = γ ((cid:16)tt + v (cid:16)xt/c2),
where the subscripts refer to the ground and train frames. If two events (for exam-
ple, two clocks flashing their times) located at the ends of the train are simultaneous
in the ground frame, then we have (cid:16)tg = 0. And (cid:16)xt = L, of course. The above
Lorentz transformation therefore gives (cid:16)tt = −Lv/c2. The minus sign here means
that the event with the larger xt value has the smaller tt value. In other words,
the front clock reads Lv/c2 less time than the rear clock, at a given instant in the
ground frame.

− (cid:16)x2
g

= c2(cid:16)t2

3. Invariant interval: This is actually just a partial derivation, because it determines
only the magnitude of the Lv/c2 result, and not the sign. The invariant interval says
that c2(cid:16)t2
t , where the subscripts refer to the ground and
g
train frames. If two events (for example, two clocks flashing their times) located at
the ends of the train are simultaneous in the ground frame, then we have (cid:16)tg = 0.
And (cid:16)xt = L, of course. And we also know from length contraction that (cid:16)xg =
L/γ . The invariant interval then gives c2(0)2 − (L/γ )2 = c2(cid:16)t2
− L2, which yields

4. Minkowski diagram: The task of Exercise 11.63 is to use a Minkowski diagram to
derive the Lv/c2 result. The basic goal is to determine how many ct
units fit in the
segment BC in Figure 11.27, and also how many ct units fit in the segment BE in
Figure 11.28.

(cid:16)

5. Walking slowly on a train: In Exercise 11.58, a person walks very slowly at speed
u from the back of a train of proper length L to the front. In the frame of the train,
the time-dilation effect is second order in u/c and therefore negligible (because the
total time is only first order in 1/u). But in the frame of the ground, the time-dilation
effect is (as you can show) first order in u/c and therefore has a nonzero effect; an
observer on the ground sees the person’s clock advance by less than a clock that is fixed
on the train. Now, the person’s clock agrees with clocks at the rear and front at the
start and finish, because of the negligible time dilation in the train frame. Therefore,
since less time elapses on the person’s clock than on the front clock (in the ground
frame), the person’s clock must have started out reading more time than the front
clock (in the ground frame). This then implies that the rear clock must show more
time than the front clock. A quantitative analysis shows that this excess time is in
fact Lv/c2.

6. Consistency arguments: There are many setups (a few examples are Problems 11.2,
11.3, 11.8, and Exercise 11.35) where the Lv/c2 result is an ingredient in explaining a
result. Without it, you would encounter a contradiction, such as two different frames
giving two different answers to a frame-independent question. So if you wanted to, you
could work backwards (under the assumption that everything is consistent in relativity)
and let the rear-clock-ahead effect be some unknown time T (which might be zero, for
all you know), and then solve for the T that makes everything consistent. You would
arrive at T = Lv/c2.

7. Gravitational time dilation: The task of Exercise 14.13 is to derive (for small v) the
Lv/c2 result by making use of the fact that Lv/c2 looks a lot like the gh/c2 term in the
GR time-dilation result. If you stand on the ground near the front of a train of length L
and then accelerate toward the back with acceleration g, you will see a clock at the back
running faster by a factor (1 + gL/c2), which will cause it to read (gL/c2)t = Lv/c2
more than a clock at the front. (Assume that you accelerate for a short period of time,
so that v ≈ gt and that the distance in the gL/c2 term remains essentially L.)

8. Accelerating rocket: The task of Problem 14.6 is to show that if a rocket with proper
length L accelerates at g and reaches a speed v, then in the ground frame the readings on
the front and rear clocks are related by tf = tb(1 + gL/c2) − Lv/c2. In other words, the
front clock reads tb(1 + gL/c2) − Lv/c2 simultaneously with the rear clock reading tb,
in the ground frame. But in the rocket frame, gravitational time dilation tells us that
the front clock reads tb(1 + gL/c2) simultaneously with the rear clock reading tb. The
difference in clock readings (front minus rear) is therefore smaller in the ground frame
than in the rocket frame, by an amount equal to Lv/c2. This is the desired result.

Appendix H Resolutions to the twin paradox

The twin paradox appeared in Chapters 11 and 14, both in the text and in various
problems. To summarize, the twin paradox deals with twin A who stays on the
earth,1 and twin B who travels quickly to a distant star and back. When they
meet up again, they discover that B is younger. This is true because A can use the
standard special-relativistic time-dilation result to say that B’s clock runs slow
by a factor γ .

The “paradox” arises from the fact that the situation seems symmetrical. That
is, it seems as though each twin should be able to consider herself to be at rest,
so that she sees the other twin’s clock running slow. So why does B turn out
to be younger? The resolution to the paradox is that the setup is in fact not
symmetrical, because B must turn around and thus undergo acceleration. She is
therefore not always in an inertial frame, so she cannot always apply the simple
special-relativistic time-dilation result.

While the above reasoning is sufficient to get rid of the paradox, it isn’t quite
complete, because (a) it doesn’t explain how the result from B’s point of view
quantitatively agrees with the result from A’s point of view, and (b) the paradox
can actually be formulated without any mention of acceleration, in which case
slightly different reasoning applies.

Below is a list of all the complete resolutions I can think of. The descriptions
are terse, but I refer you to the specific problem or section in the text where things
are discussed in more detail. As with the Lv/c2 derivations in Appendix G, many
of these resolutions are slight variations on each other, so perhaps they shouldn’t
all count as separate ones, but here’s my list:

1. Rear-clock-ahead effect: Let the distant star be labeled as C. Then on the outward
part of the journey, B sees C’s clock ahead of A’s by Lv/c2, because C is the rear clock
in the universe as the universe flies by. But after B turns around, A becomes the rear
clock and is therefore now ahead of C. This means that A’s clock must jump forward
very quickly, from B’s point of view. (See Section 11.3.1 and Problem 11.2.)

1 We should actually have A floating in space, to avoid any GR time-dilation effects from the earth’s

gravity. But if B travels quickly enough, the SR effects will dominate the gravitational ones.

706

Resolutions to the twin paradox

2. Looking out of the portholes: Imagine many clocks lined up between the earth and the
star, all synchronized in the earth–star frame. And imagine looking out of the portholes
of the spaceship and making a movie of the clocks as you fly past them. Although
you see each individual clock running slow, you see the “effective” clock in the movie
(which is really many successive clocks) running fast. This effect is just a series of
small applications (see Problem 11.2) of the rear-clock-ahead effect mentioned above.
3. Minkowski diagram: Draw a Minkowski diagram with the axes in A’s frame per-
pendicular. Then the lines of simultaneity (that is, the successive x axes) in B’s frame
are titled in different directions for the outward and inward parts of the journey. The
change in the tilt at the turnaround causes a large amount of time to advance on A’s
clock, as measured in B’s frame. (See Section 11.7 and Figure 11.68.)

4. General-relativistic turnaround effect: The acceleration that B feels when she turns
around may equivalently be thought of as a gravitational field. Twin A on the earth is
high up in the gravitational field, so B sees A’s clock run very fast during the turnaround.
This causes A’s clock to show more time in the end. (See Problem 14.9.)

5. Doppler effect: By equating the total number of signals one twin sends out with the
total number of signals the other twin receives, we can relate the total times on their
clocks. (See Exercise 11.67.)

Fig. I.1

In this appendix, we will give an alternate derivation of
the Lorentz
transformations in Eq. (11.17). The goal here is to derive them from scratch,
using only the two postulates of relativity. We will not use any of the results
derived in Section 11.3. Our strategy will be to use the relativity postulate (“all
inertial frames are equivalent”) to figure out as much as we can, and to then invoke
the speed-of-light postulate at the end. The main reason for doing things in this
order is that it will allow us to derive a very interesting result in Section 11.10.
As in Section 11.4, consider a coordinate system S(cid:16) moving relative to another
system S (see Fig. I.1). Let the constant relative speed between the frames be
v. Let the corresponding axes of S and S(cid:16) point in the same direction, and let
the origin of S(cid:16) move along the x axis of S, in the positive direction. As in
Section 11.4, we want to find the constants, A, B, C, and D, in the relations,

(cid:16)x = A (cid:16)x

(I.1)

The four constants will end up depending on v (which is constant, given the
two inertial frames). Since we have four unknowns, we need four facts. The
facts we have at our disposal (using only the two postulates of relativity) are the
following.

3. The speed-of-light postulate: A light pulse with speed c in S

(cid:16)

also has speed c in S.

The second statement here contains two independent bits of information. (It con-
tains at least two, because we will indeed be able to solve for our four unknowns.
And it contains no more than two, because then our four unknowns would be
over-constrained.) The two bits that are used depend on personal preference.
Three that are commonly used are: (a) the relative speed looks the same from
either frame, (b) time dilation (if any) looks the same from either frame, and

708

Lorentz transformations

709

(c) length contraction (if any) looks the same from either frame. It is also common
to recast the second statement in the form: The Lorentz transformations are the
same as their inverse transformations (up to a possible minus sign). We’ll choose
to work with (a) and (b). Our four independent facts are then:

(cid:16)

travels with velocity v with respect to S.
1. S
2. S travels with velocity −v with respect to S

(cid:16)

. The minus sign here is due to the
convention that we picked the positive x axes of the two frames to point in the same
direction.

3. Time dilation (if any) looks the same from either frame.

also has speed c in S.

fact prior to the time-dilation one. But we’ll do things in the above order so that we can easily carry
